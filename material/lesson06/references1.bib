  abstract = 	 {Despite its importance, choosing the structural form of the kernel in nonparametric regression remains a black art. We define a space of kernel structures which are built compositionally by adding and multiplying a small number of base kernels. We present a method for searching over this space of structures which mirrors the scientific discovery process. The learned structures can often decompose functions into interpretable components and enable long-range extrapolation on time-series datasets. Our structure search method outperforms many widely used kernels and kernel combination methods on a variety of prediction tasks.}

@article{Stewart16,
abstract = {In many machine learning applications, labeled data is scarce and obtaining more labels is expensive. We introduce a new approach to supervising neural networks by specifying constraints that should hold over the output space, rather than direct examples of input-output pairs. These constraints are derived from prior domain knowledge, e.g., from known laws of physics. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on real world and simulated computer vision tasks. We are able to train a convolutional neural network to detect and track objects without any labeled examples. Our approach can significantly reduce the need for labeled training data, but introduces new challenges for encoding prior knowledge into appropriate loss functions.},

@misc{vonRueden19,
abstract = {Despite the great successes of machine learning, it can have its limits when dealing with insufficient training data.A potential solution is to incorporate additional knowledge into the training process which leads to the idea of informed machine learning. We present a research survey and structured overview of various approaches in this field. We aim to establish a taxonomy which can serve as a classification framework that considers the kind of additional knowledge, its representation,and its integration into the machine learning pipeline. The evaluation of numerous papers on the bases of the taxonomy uncovers key methods in this field.},

@article{Allen09,
    abstract = {Global efforts to mitigate climate change are guided by projections of future temperatures1. But the eventual equilibrium global mean temperature associated with a given stabilization level of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations remains uncertain1, 2, 3, complicating the setting of stabilization targets to avoid potentially dangerous levels of global warming4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Similar problems apply to the carbon cycle: observations currently provide only a weak constraint on the response to future emissions9, 10, 11. Here we use ensemble simulations of simple climate-carbon-cycle models constrained by observations and projections from more comprehensive models to simulate the temperature response to a broad range of carbon dioxide emission pathways. We find that the peak warming caused by a given cumulative carbon dioxide emission is better constrained than the warming response to a stabilization scenario. Furthermore, the relationship between cumulative emissions and peak warming is remarkably insensitive to the emission pathway (timing of emissions or peak emission rate). Hence policy targets based on limiting cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide are likely to be more robust to scientific uncertainty than emission-rate or concentration targets. Total anthropogenic emissions of one trillion tonnes of carbon (3.67 trillion tonnes of {CO2}), about half of which has already been emitted since industrialization began, results in a most likely peak carbon-dioxide-induced warming of 2 °C above pre-industrial temperatures, with a 5–95\% confidence interval of 1.3–3.9 °C.},

  abstract = {The terrestrial carbon sink has been large in recent decades, but its size and location remain uncertain. Using forest inventory data and long-term ecosystem carbon studies, we estimate a total forest sink of 2.4 ± 0.4 petagrams of carbon per year (Pg C year–1) globally for 1990 to 2007. We also estimate a source of 1.3 ± 0.7 Pg C year–1 from tropical land-use change, consisting of a gross tropical deforestation emission of 2.9 ± 0.5 Pg C year–1 partially compensated by a carbon sink in tropical forest regrowth of 1.6 ± 0.5 Pg C year–1. Together, the fluxes comprise a net global forest sink of 1.1 ± 0.8 Pg C year–1, with tropical estimates having the largest uncertainties. Our total forest sink estimate is equivalent in magnitude to the terrestrial sink deduced from fossil fuel emissions and land-use change sources minus ocean and atmospheric sinks.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the performance and applicability of a novel kernel
	partial least squares (KPLS) algorithm for nonlinear feature extraction
	in the context of remote sensing applications. The so-called kernel
	orthonormalized PLS algorithm with reduced complexity (rKOPLS) has
	the following two core parts: 1) a kernel version of OPLS (called
	KOPLS) and 2) a sparse approximation for large-scale data sets, which
	ultimately leads to the rKOPLS algorithm. The method is theoretically
	analyzed in terms of computational burden and memory requirements
	and is tested in common remote sensing applications: multi- and hyper-spectral
	image classification and biophysical parameter estimation problems.
	The proposed method largely outperforms the traditional (linear)
	PLS algorithm and demonstrates good capabilities in terms of expressive
	power of the extracted nonlinear features, accuracy, and scalability
	as compared to the standard KPLS. © 2008 IEEE.},

  abstract = {The point of maximum slope on the reflectance spectrum of a plant
	leaf between red and near-infrared wavelengths is known as the red

	content, and hence it provides a very sensitive indicator for a variety
	of environmental factors affecting leaves such as stress, drought
	and senescence. The REP is also present in spectra for vegetation
	recorded by remote sensing methods. Due to its importance for the
	application of inversion procedures, a number of techniques have
	been developed for determining the REP for foliar spectral reflectance.
	In this paper a new approach is proposed. It allows an unsupervised
	estimation of the REP. The accuracy of the new approach is evaluated
	by comparing REP estimates with values derived from measured spectral
	data for woody and herbaceous species available in the LOPEX (Leaf
	Optical Properties Experiment) database. © 2005 Taylor \& Francis

	and evergreen broadleaf forests. These three networks represent all

	surfaces at the global scale. While several products were already
	developed from the current medium resolution sensors, the few validation
	exercises currently achieved highlighted significant discrepancies
	and inconsistencies. The objective of this study is to develop improved
	global estimates of LAI, {FAPAR} and {FCOVER} variables by capitalizing
	on the development and validation of already existing products. In
	a first step, the performances of the MODIS, CYCLOPES, {GLOBCARBON}
	and JRC-FAPAR products were reviewed. The {MODIS} and {CYCLOPES}
	products were then selected since they provide higher level of consistency.
	These products were fused to generate the improved LAI, {FAPAR}
	and {FCOVER} values that were later scaled to closely match their
	expected range of variation. Finally, neural networks were trained
	to estimate these fused and scaled products from SPOT-VEGETATION
	top of canopy directionally normalized reflectance values. The resulting
	{GEOV1} products are associated to quality control flags as well
	as quantitative estimates of uncertainties. Performances of the {GEOV1}
	products are finally evaluated in a companion paper. The {GEOV1}
	products are freely available to the community at www.geoland2.eu
	from 1999 up to present, globally at 1/112° spatial sampling grid
	at the dekadal time step.},

  abstract = {Hyperspectral reflectance data representing a wide range of canopies
	were simulated using the combined PROSPECT+SAIL model. The simulations
	were used to study the stability of recently proposed vegetation
	indices (VIs) derived from adjacent narrowband spectral reflectance
	data across the visible (VIS) and near infrared (NIR) region of the
	electromagnetic spectrum. The prediction power of these indices with
	respect to green leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll density
	(CCD) was compared, and their sensitivity to canopy architecture,
	illumination geometry, soil background reflectance, and atmospheric
	conditions were analyzed. The second soil-adjusted vegetation index
	(SAVI2) proved to be the best overall choice as a greenness measure.
	However, it is also shown that the dynamics of the VIs are very different
	in terms of their sensitivity to the different external factors that
	affects the spectral reflectance signatures of the various modeled
	canopies. It is concluded that hyperspectral indices are not necessarily
	better at predicting LAI and CCD, but that selection of a VI should
	depend upon (1) which parameter that needs to be estimated (LAI or
	CCD), (2) the expected range of this parameter, and (3) a priori
	knowledge of the variation of external parameters affecting the spectral

  abstract = {This paper describes the scientific validation of the first version
	of global biophysical products (i.e., leaf area index, fraction of
	absorbed photosynthetically active radiation and fraction of vegetation
	cover), namely GEOV1, developed in the framework of the geoland-2/BioPar
	core mapping service at 1. km spatial resolution and 10-days temporal
	frequency. The strategy follows the recommendations of the CEOS/WGCV
	Land Product Validation for LAI global products validation. Several
	criteria of performance were evaluated, including continuity, spatial
	and temporal consistency, dynamic range of retrievals, statistical
	analysis per biome type, precision and accuracy. The spatial and
	temporal consistencies of GEOV1 products were assessed by intercomparison
	with reference global products (MODIS c5, CYCLOPES v3.1, GLOBCARBON
	v2 LAI, and JRC SeaWIFS FAPAR) over a global network of homogeneous
	sites (BELMANIP-2) during the 2003-2005 period. The accuracy of GEOV1
	was evaluated against a number of available ground reference maps.
	Our results show that GEOV1 products present reliable spatial distribution,
	smooth temporal profiles which are stable from year to year, good
	dynamic range with reliable magnitude for bare areas and dense forests,
	and optimal performances with ground-based maps. GEOV1 outperforms
	the quality of reference global products in most of the examined
	criteria, and constitutes a step forward in the development of consistent
	and accurate global biophysical variables within the context of the
	land monitoring core service of GMES. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {The main objective was to determine whether partial least squares
	(PLS) regression improves grass/herb biomass estimation when compared
	with hyperspectral indices, that is normalised difference vegetation
	index (NDVI) and red-edge position (REP). To achieve this objective,
	fresh green grass/herb biomass and airborne images (HyMap) were collected
	in the Majella National Park, Italy in the summer of 2005. The predictive
	performances of hyperspectral indices and PLS regression models were
	then determined and compared using calibration (n = 30) and test
	(n = 12) data sets. The regression model derived from NDVI computed
	from bands at 740 and 771 nm produced a lower standard error of prediction
	(SEP = 264 g m-2) on the test data compared with the standard NDVI
	involving bands at 665 and 801 nm (SEP = 331 g m-2), but comparable
	results with REPs determined by various methods (SEP = 261 to 295
	g m-2). PLS regression models based on original, derivative and continuum-removed
	spectra produced lower prediction errors (SEP = 149 to 256 g m-2)
	compared with NDVI and REP models. The lowest prediction error (SEP
	= 149 g m-2, 19% of mean) was obtained with PLS regression involving
	continuum-removed bands. In conclusion, PLS regression based on airborne
	hyperspectral imagery provides a better alternative to univariate
	regression involving hyperspectral indices for grass/herb biomass
	estimation in the Majella National Park. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

  abstract = {Abstract This study aims at validating Leaf Area Index (LAI) and Fraction
	of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) products
	derived from {MODIS} surface reflectance (MOD09CMG) at coarse resolution
	(0.05°) over crops. These Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) are
	estimated by using the inversion of the {PROSAIL} radiative transfer
	(BV-NNET tool) applied on {MODIS} {BRDF} (Bidirectional Reflectance
	Distribution Function) corrected surface reflectances and non-corrected.
	{ECV} estimates and the corresponding {MCD15A3} Collection 5
	and GEOLAND-2 (GEOv1) products are compared with {ECV} reference
	maps derived from BV-NNET applied on 105 high spatial resolution
	images (Formosat-2, 8&#xa0;m) which were acquired from 2006 to 2010
	in Southwest France. These latter are compared with local scale in
	situ measurements. The validation shows an uncertainty of 0.35 and
	0.07 for {LAI} and FAPAR, respectively. The comparison shows that
	the {ECV} estimates from the three products properly capture the
	crops phenology in agreement with reference maps. Results indicate
	that {MCD15A3} uncertainties (0.23 and 0.07 for {LAI} and FAPAR,
	respectively) are similar to previous intercomparison studies. {GEOv1}
	shows a systemic positive bias for both {LAI} and FAPAR. The best
	agreement with the reference maps is found for {MODIS} BV-NNET
	products with r2 higher than 0.9 and relative uncertainties lower
	than 17%. The use of BRDF-corrected surface reflectances as input
	of BV-NNET tool improves the uncertainty of {LAI} estimates (0.11,
	compared to 0.17 when directional surface reflectances are used as
	input) but not the uncertainty of {FAPAR} estimates. The deviation
	between {FAPAR} products which mostly affects low winter FAPAR,
	is related to the discrepancy of the soil directional assumption
	in {PROSAIL} model and {BRDF} correction method. The temporal
	stability of the daily {MODIS} BV-NNET products is better than
	the 4-day composite {MCD15A3} products. Finally, BV-NNET tool applied
	at finer resolutions demonstrates that the increase of the resolution
	results in a decrease of the {LAI} and {FAPAR} uncertainties
	and a conservation of the biases.},

	and biophysical data were obtained over 132 plots of sugar beet (Beta
	vulgaris L.) and in the first part of the paper the strength of the
	relationships between vegetation indices (VI) and leaf area index
	(LAI) are examined. In the second part, an approach is tested in
	which a canopy reflectance model is used to generate simulated spectra
	for a wide range of biophysical conditions and these data are used
	to train an artificial neural network (ANN). The advantage of the
	second approach is that a priori knowledge of the measurement conditions
	including soil reflectance, canopy architecture and solar position
	can be included explicitly in the modelling. The results show that
	the estimation of sugar beet LAI using a trained neural network is
	more reliable than the use of VI and has the potential to replace
	the use of VI for operational applications. The use of a priori data
	on the variation in soil spectral reflectance gave rise to a small
	increase in LAI estimation accuracy.},

	grasslands. In this paper, both modeling approaches are investigated
	for mapping leaf area index (LAI) in a Mediterranean grassland (Majella
	National Park, Italy) using HyMap airborne hyperspectral images.
	We compared inversion of the PROSAIL radiative transfer model with
	narrow band vegetation indices (NDVI-like and SAVI2-like) and partial
	least squares regression (PLS). To assess the performance of the
	investigated models, the normalized RMSE (nRMSE) and R2 between in
	situ measurements of leaf area index and estimated parameter values
	are reported. The results of the study demonstrate that LAI can be
	estimated through PROSAIL inversion with accuracies comparable to
	those of statistical approaches (R2=0.89, nRMSE=0.22). The accuracy
	of the radiative transfer model inversion was further increased by
	using only a spectral subset of the data (R2=0.91, nRMSE=0.18). For
	the feature selection wavebands not well simulated by PROSAIL were
	sequentially discarded until all bands fulfilled the imposed accuracy

	imagery combining both high spatial resolution with high revisit
	frequency. The monitoring of land surface processes will greatly
	benefit from this type of data if biophysical variables such as Leaf
	Area Index (LAI) can be retrieved from it. However, the large amounts
	of data that will become available call for methods satisfying constraint
	of (i) portability across different landscapes, (ii) independence
	from field measurements and (iii) computational efficiency. Currently,
	the most suitable technique to approach this objective is neural
	network inversion of radiative transfer. This paper quantifies the
	performance of such approach for a specific crop (winter wheat) all
	along the growing season. By re-defining the retrieved biophysical
	variable as Green Area Index (GAI) and correcting the typical saturation
	effect that affects the estimation of higher values, this study shows
	that physically-based retrieval can yield similar results to those
	obtained by empirical methods such as stepwise linear regression
	(with an relative RMSE of 24.7% and 22.8% respectively). The research
	further shows how a trained neural network for a specific sensor
	can produce a GAI map from imagery acquired from different viewing
	conditions without a significant loss in accuracy. © 2010 Elsevier

  abstract = {Leaf area index (LAI) is a critical variable for land surface and
	climate modeling studies. Several global LAI products exist, and
	it is important to know how these products perform and what their
	uncertainties are. Five major global LAI products - MODIS, GEOV1,
	GLASS, GLOBMAP, and JRC-TIP - were compared between 2003 and 2010
	at a 0.01° spatial resolution and with a monthly time step. The
	daily Land-SAF product was used as a regional reference in order
	to evaluate the performance of other global products in Africa. Cross-sensor
	LAI conversion equations were derived for different biome types.
	Product uncertainties were assessed by looking into the product quantitative
	quality indicators (QQIs) attached to MODIS, GEOV1, and JRC-TIP.
	MODIS, GEOV1, GLASS, and GLOBMAP are generally consistent and show
	strong linear relationships between the products (R2 &gt; 0.74),
	with typical deviations of &lt; 0.5 for nonforest and &lt; 1.0 for
	forest biomes. JRC-TIP, the only effective LAI product, is about
	half the values of the other LAI products. The average uncertainties
	and relative uncertainties are in the following order: MODIS (0.17,
	11.5%) &lt; GEOV1 (0.24, 26.6%) &lt; Land-SAF (0.36, 37.8%) &lt;
	JRC-TIP (0.43, 114.3%). The highest relative uncertainties usually
	appear in ecological transition zones. More than 75% of MODIS, GEOV1,
	JRC-TIP, and Land-SAF pixels are within the absolute uncertainty
	requirements (± 0.5) set by the Global Climate Observing System
	(GCOS), whereas more than 78.5% of MODIS and 44.6% of GEOV1 pixels
	are within the threshold for relative uncertainty (20%). This study
	reveals the discrepancies mainly due to differences between definitions,
	retrieval algorithms, and input data. Future product development
	and validation studies should focus on areas (e.g., sparsely vegetated
	and savanna areas) and periods (e.g., winter time) with higher uncertainties.

  abstract = {The objective of this paper is to quantitatively validate the global
	MODIS and CYCLOPES leaf area index (LAI) products using a global
	LAI field measurement database created on the basis of a literature
	review and major validation campaigns. The MODIS LAI product suite,
	containing the Terra Collection 4 (C4), Terra Collection 5 (C5) and
	Terra. +. Aqua combined C5, was analyzed, with considerable attention
	paid to the quality control (QC) information. The CYCLOPES V3.1 LAI
	product was similarly analyzed with regard to the status map (SM)
	layer. In general, the MODIS LAI has improved consistently over all
	releases. MODIS C5 data retrieved with the main algorithm (QC < 64)
	and CYCLOPES data showed a similar range of uncertainties (1.0-1.2).
	Uncertainties for the best MODIS C5 (QC = 0) and CYCLOPES (SM = 0)
	estimates were around 0.9-1.1. The overall mean differences between
	the best MODIS C5 and CYCLOPES were within ± 0.10. The highest correspondence
	was obtained for woody biomes from the best MCD15 C5 data (RMSE =
	0.80). Results indicate that the uncertainties in current LAI products
	(around ± 1.0) are still unable to meet the accuracy requirement
	of GCOS (± 0.5). Although there are limitations, we recommend MODIS
	C5 retrieved with the main algorithm (QC < 64) and CYCLOPES for the
	user community. This study demonstrates the necessity of exploring
	uncertainties related to the true and effective LAIs separately,
	and reveals the importance of referring to the quality assessment
	information. More field measurements are required for further studies,
	which should focus on under-sampled biome types and areas. © 2011

  number = {7},
  abstract = {Protein, lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, sugar, and starch contents
	per unit leaf area of fresh leaves were related to the corresponding
	reflectance and transmittance spectra using multiple linear regressions.
	When the regressions are evaluated over the data set used for calibrating,
	they show relatively good performances. However, applying these relations
	to an independent data set led to very poor performances. It was
	concluded that the detailed canopy biochemistry was not accessible
	in a robust way from fresh leaf optical properties measurements over
	a large range of leaf types. The only variables that can be accurately
	derived from leaf reflectance or transmittance measurements are water
	and dry matter (i.e., the specific leaf weight) contents per unit
	leaf area. Transforming reflectance (\CF?) or transmittance (τ) values
	into the corresponding absorbance (log(1/τ) or log(1/τ)) values
	improves the accuracy of the estimates. Using transmittance rather
	than reflectance provides better retrieval performances. We investigated
	the sensitivity of the relationships to the radiometric noise associated
	to reflectance or transmittance measurements. It appears, particularly
	for water, that the estimates are quite sensitive to the radiometric
	resolution of the instrument used. We propose a technique that minimizes
	the sensitivity of the estimates to the radiometric noise and improves
	their robustness. It consists of enlarging the calibration data set
	by adding random instrumental noise similar to that observed over
	the test data set. Results show that, this way, three wavebands (1910,
	1380, and 900 nm for water; 2310, 2160, and 1870nm for dry matter)
	allow good estimates of water (RMSE = 0.0011 g cm-2) and dry matter
	contents (RMSE = 0.0008 g cm-2).},

  abstract = {Most bacterial and fungal plant pathogens require free moisture for
	infection and reproduction so a disease forecasting model needs to
	estimate wetness duration on plant surfaces if direct measurement
	is unavailable. Artificial neural network (ANN) models with a backpropagation
	architecture were developed to predict wetness on wheat flag leaves
	using environmental variables recorded at 0.5 h intervals by an electronic
	datalogger. For comparison, multivariate discriminant and stepwise
	logistic models also predicted wetness, and dew periods were predicted
	with a classification tree-discrimination approach, a relative humidity
	indicator, and a physical model. ANN and logistic models correctly
	classified 93% and 90% of the validation cases and were more accurate
	than discriminant models. Many of the ANN errors occurred during
	times of dew onset or evaporation and were ≤ 1 h per event. Model
	accuracy for all methods improved 3-4% when input data from a wetness
	sensor positioned above vegetation were included. The average absolute
	error per night for prediction of dew period was 0.6 h for the classification-discrimination
	model, 0.8-1.1 h for ANN models, 1.2 h for a logistic model, 1.4
	h for the physical model, and 2.1 h for the relative humidity index.
	ANN and logistic models thus performed well compared to previously
	developed models for prediction of dew duration and these models
	predicted leaf wetness from both dew and rain, an advantage for disease
	forecasting. Further improvements in ANN performance are possible,
	making the technique a viable research tool.},

  abstract = {The inversion of physically based reflectance models is increasingly
	efficient for extracting vegetation variables from remote sensing
	images. It requires a vegetation reflectance model and an inversion
	method that are accurate and efficient. Usually, the complexity of
	reflectance models implies to use specific inversion methods (e.g.,
	look-up table and neural network). Unfortunately, these methods are
	valid only for the view-sun directions for which they are designed.
	A developed look-up table based inversion method avoids this limitation:
	it generalizes any look-up table for any view-sun direction, and
	more generally for any input parameter value. It uses a look-up table
	made of ci coefficients of any analytical expression h that fits
	a set of reflectance values simulated by the Discrete Anisotropic
	Radiative Transfer (DART) model. Interpolation on coefficients ci
	allows h to give reflectance values for any input parameter value.
	We settled some options of the inversion method with sensitivity
	studies: tree covers are simulated with 4-tree scenes, expression
	h has six coefficients ci and the interpolation is the continuous
	first derivative interpolation method. Moreover, the robustness of
	the inversion method was validated. The ability to generalize a look-up
	table for any view-sun direction was successfully tested with the
	inversion of SPOT images of Fontainebleau (France) forest. LAI maps
	proved to be as accurate (i.e., RMSE ≈ 1.3) as those obtained with
	classical relationships that are calibrated with in situ LAI measurements.
	Here, the advantage of our inversion method was to avoid this calibration.

  abstract = {In recent years, hyperspectral and multi-angular approaches for quantifying
	biophysical characteristics of vegetation have become more widely
	used. In fact, as both hyperspectral and multi-angle reflectance
	decrease the level of noise on retrieved geophysical parameter values,
	they increase their reliability by also reducing the saturation problem
	of the relationships between vegetation indices and biophysical characteristics.
	To test which is the best methodology in estimating some important
	biophysical grassland parameters (biomass, total and percent biomass
	nitrogen content, phytomass and its total and percent nitrogen content),
	nadir and off-nadir measurements were carried out, three times during
	the vegetative period of 2004, in a permanent flat meadow located
	in the experimental farm of the University of Padua, Italy. The two
	approaches and the broad band vegetation indices calculated using
	Landsat bands were compared considering both the best determination
	coefficients of five vegetation indices, calculated with the two
	analysis, and through a partial least squares regression using different
	spectral regions measured at different angles as predictive variables.
	Using nadir data the red edge region was the most useful for the
	prediction of biophysical variables, especially phytomass, but also
	nitrogen content. The off-nadir data did not provide any significance
	differences in results to that of data obtained in nadir view but
	both methods seem to be better adapted to describe biophysical parameters
	of vegetation than the use of broad band vegetation indices.},

  abstract = {Leaf chlorophyll content provides valuable information about physiological
	status of plants. Reflectance measurement makes it possible to quickly
	and non-destructively assess, in situ, the chlorophyll content in
	leaves. Our objective was to investigate the spectral behavior of
	the relationship between reflectance and chlorophyll content and
	to develop a technique for non-destructive chlorophyll estimation
	in leaves with a wide range of pigment content and composition using
	reflectance in a few broad spectral bands. Spectral reflectance of
	maple, chestnut, wild vine and beech leaves in a wide range of pigment
	content and composition was investigated. It was shown that reciprocal
	reflectance (Rλ)-1 in the spectral range λ from 520 to 550 nm and
	695 to 705 nm related closely to the total chlorophyll content in
	leaves of all species. Subtraction of near infra-red reciprocal reflectance,
	(RNIR)-1, from (Rλ)-1 made index [(Rλ)-1-(RNIR)-1] linearly proportional
	to the total chlorophyll content in spectral ranges λ from 525 to
	555 nm and from 695 to 725 nm with coefficient of determination r2
	&gt; 0.94. To adjust for differences in leaf structure, the product
	of the latter index and NIR reflectance [(Rλ)-1-(RNIR)-1]* (RNIR)
	was used; this further increased the accuracy of the chlorophyll
	estimation in the range λ from 520 to 585 nm and from 695 to 740
	nm. Two independent data sets were used to validate the developed
	algorithms. The root mean square error of the chlorophyll prediction
	did not exceed 50 μmol/m2 in leaves with total chlorophyll ranged
	from 1 to 830 μmol/m2.},

	and one dry leaf datasets containing a broad range of native and
	cultivated plant species were examined using unconstrainied stepwise
	multiple linear regression and constrained regression with wavelengths
	reported from other leaf level studies and wavelengths derived from
	chemical spectroscopy. Although stepwise multiple linear regression
	explained large amounts of the variation in the chemical data, the
	bands selected were not related to known absorption bauds, varied
	among datasets and expression bases for the chemical [concentration
	(g g-1) or content (g m-2)], did not correspond to bands selected
	in other studies, and were sensitive to the samples entered into
	the regression. Stepwise multiple regression using artificially constucted
	datasets that randomized the association between nitrogen concentration
	and reflectance spectra produced coefficients of determination (R2's)
	between 0.41 and 0.82 for first and second derivative lag(1/R) spectra.
	The R2's for correctly-paired nitrogen data and first and second
	derivative log(1/R) only exceeded the average randomized R2's by
	0.02- 0.42. Replication of this randomization experiment otl a larger
	dry ground leaf data set from the Harvard Forest showed the same
	trends but lower R2's. All of these results suggest caution in the
	use of stepwise mutliple linear regression on fresh leaf reflectance
	spectra. Band selection does not appear to be based upon the absorption

	(MODIS) land cover products are 500-m sub-pixel representations of
	basic vegetation characteristics including tree, herbaceous and bare
	ground cover. Our previous approach to deriving continuous fields
	used a linear mixture model based on spectral endmembers of forest,
	grassland and bare ground training. We present here a new approach
	for estimating percent tree cover employing continuous training data
	over the whole range of tree cover. The continuous training data
	set is derived by aggregating high-resolution tree cover to coarse
	scales and is used with multi-temporal metrics based on a full year
	of coarse resolution satellite data. A regression tree algorithm
	is used to predict the dependent variable of tree cover based on
	signatures from the multi-temporal metrics. The automated algorithm
	was tested globally using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
	(AVHRR) data, as a full year of MODIS data has not yet been collected.
	A root mean square error (rmse) of 9.06% tree cover was found from
	the global training data set. Preliminary MODIS products are also
	presented, including a 250-m map of the lower 48 United States and
	500-m maps of tree cover and leaf type for North America. Results
	show that the new approach used with MODIS data offers an improved
	characterization of land cover. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All

	may function as an important source of data for site-specific crop

	strategies to obtain optimum yield and grain quality. Here, the objective
	was to use early repeated remotely sensed multi-spectral data to
	predict grain yield and quality for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum
	L.) and spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). The crops were sown with
	two different seeding rates and a wide range of nitrogen strategies
	were applied. Multi-way partial least squares regression (N-PLS)
	was used to predict grain yield and protein content. The results
	were compared with unfold-PLS1 and PLS1 using reflectance data from
	the last measurement day. Both single reflectance wavelengths and
	selected vegetation indices were used simultaneously. The results
	reveal that all models can make a good prediction of yield in both
	crops with unfold-PLS1 and N-PLS as the best. However, estimation
	of grain protein content at harvest was very poorly determined in
	barley, as no relation between the reflectance measurements and barley
	protein content was obtained. The relation between reflectance measurements
	and protein content was slightly better in wheat, where especially
	N-PLS improved the prediction of grain protein content. The overall
	conclusion of the present experiments is that data from repeated
	measurements of reflectance used in multi-way partial least squares
	regression before heading improved the prediction of grain yield
	and protein content in wheat and barley.},

  abstract = {For crop management, information on the actual status of the crop
	is important for taking decisions on nitrogen supply, water supply
	or harvesting. One would also like to take into account the local
	spatial variation of the crop. Remote sensing has proved to be a
	useful technique for estimating and mapping the spatial variation
	of various biophysical variables. Calibration of the image data is
	crucial in the performance and applicability of this technique. The
	aim of this paper is to show the possibility to calibrate remotely
	sensed imagery using fast and non-destructive close-range (below
	1.3 m height) sensing instruments, thus providing a means for the
	assessment of plant characteristics over large areas at low costs.
	This concept was tested on a homogeneously managed grassland field,
	subdivided into 20 plots of 15 × 3 m, at the end of July 2004. Reflected
	radiation was recorded with an active close-range sensing device,
	consisting of a visible light and near-infrared (NIR) imaging spectrograph,
	and a 3CCD camera, equipped with special band filters (central wavelengths
	are at 600, 710 and 800 nm). An airborne campaign with a four-band
	UltraCam digital CCD camera was used for extrapolation to larger
	scales. Plots were harvested, and fresh and dry biomass and leaf
	nitrogen content were determined. Partial least squares (PLS) models
	combining spectral and spatial information from the close-sensing
	device yielded acceptable results in predicting grassland yields
	and nitrogen content. Subsequently, these predictions were used to
	calibrate a model with the image data of the remote sensing device.
	These were then compared, using leave-one-out cross-validation, with
	the measured field variables, and the model proved to have an acceptable
	predictive power.},

  abstract = {The concentrations of various foliar chemicals can be estimated by
	analyzing the spectral reflectance of dried ground leaves. The continuum-removal
	analysis of Kokaly and Clark [Remote Sens. Environ. 67 (1999) 267]
	has been an improvement on the standard derivative analysis in such
	applications. Continuum-removal analysis enables the isolation of
	absorption features of interest, thus increasing the coefficients
	of determination and facilitating the identification of more sensible
	absorption features. The purpose of this study was to test Kokaly
	and Clark's methodology with aircraft-acquired hyperspectral data
	of eucalypt tree canopies, which are more complex than are spectra
	from many coniferous canopies and much more complex than the spectra
	from dried ground leaves. The results of the continuum-removal analysis
	were most encouraging. It identified, in one experiment or another,
	almost all of the known nitrogen absorption features. The coefficient
	of determination in one case increased from 0.65, using the standard
	derivative analysis, to 0.85 with the continuum-removal analysis.
	It is recommended that continuum-removal analysis become at least
	a supplement to standard derivative analysis in estimating foliar
	biochemical concentrations from remote sensing data. This study also
	reports several other findings: (1) the neural network method generally
	achieved higher coefficients of determination and lower errors of
	estimation [root mean square error (RMSE) and standard error of cross
	validation (SECV)] than did the modified partial least squares (PLS)
	or stepwise regression methods, probably indicating nonlinear relationships
	between biochemical concentrations and canopy reflectance; (2) modified
	partial least squares (MPLS) proved a better statistical method than
	conventional stepwise regression analysis in many cases in terms
	of both coefficient of determination and RMSE; and (3) the maximum
	spectrum of a cluster of tree pixels represents canopy reflectance
	at least as well as the mean spectrum of the cluster, especially
	when used in conjunction with the modified partial least squares
	method. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	HyMap airborne data (126 bands at 2.3 × 2.3 m spatial resolution),
	collected over the U.S. Department of Energy uranium processing sites
	near Monticello, Utah and Monument Valley, Arizona, were used. Grass
	and shrub species were mixed on an engineered disposal cell cover

	plantings at the Monument Valley site. Regression trees resulted
	in the best calibration performance of LAI estimation (R 2 &gt; 0.80.
	The use of REPs failed to accurately predict LAI (R 2 &lt; 0.2).
	The use of the MTMF-derived metrics (matched filter scores and infeasibility)
	and a range of vegetation indices in decision trees improved the
	vegetation mapping when compared to the decision tree classification
	using just the scaled reflectance. Results suggest that hyperspectral
	imagery are useful for characterizing biophysical characteristics
	(LAI) and vegetation cover on capped hazardous waste sites. However,
	it is believed that the vegetation mapping would benefit from the
	use of higher spatial resolution hyperspectral data due to the small
	size of many of the vegetation patches (&lt;1 m) found on the sites.

  abstract = {Chlorophyll contents in vegetation depend on soil nitrogen availability
	and on crop nitrogen uptake, which are important management factors
	in arable farming. Crop nitrogen uptake is important, as nitrogen
	is needed for chlorophyll formation, which is important for photosynthesis,
	i.e. the conversion of absorbed radiance into plant biomass. The
	objective of this study was to estimate leaf and canopy nitrogen
	contents by near and remote sensing observations and to link observations
	at leaf, plant and canopy level. A theoretical base is presented
	for scaling-up leaf optical properties to whole plants and crops,
	by linking different optical recording techniques at leaf, plant
	and canopy levels through the integration of vertical nitrogen distribution.
	Field data come from potato experiments in The Netherlands in 1997
	and 1998, comprising two potato varieties: Eersteling and Bintje,
	receiving similar nitrogen treatments (0, 100, 200 and 300 kg N ha-1)
	in varying application schemes to create differences in canopy nitrogen
	status during the growing season. Ten standard destructive field
	samplings were performed to follow leaf area index and crop dry weight
	evolution. Samples were analysed for inorganic nitrogen and total
	nitrogen contents. At sampling dates, spectral measurements were
	taken both at leaf level and at canopy level. At leaf level, an exponential
	relation between SPAD-502 readings and leaf organic nitrogen contents
	with a high correlation factor of 0.91 was found. At canopy level,
	an exponential relation between canopy organic nitrogen contents
	and red edge position (λ rep, nm) derived from reflectance measurements
	was found with a good correlation of 0.82. Spectral measurements
	(SPAD-502) at leaf level of a few square mm were related to canopy
	reflectance measurements (CropScan™) of approximately 0.44 m2.
	Statistical regression techniques were used to optimise theoretical
	vertical nitrogen profiles that allowed scaling-up leaf chlorophyll
	measurements to canopy nitrogen values. A nitrogen attenuation coefficient
	(kN) of 0.41 g N m-2 soil resulted in highest correlation coefficients
	for scaling-up nitrogen contents from leaf to canopy values. Remote
	sensing of canopy nitrogen (g N m-2 soil) did not require considering
	vertical nitrogen profiles, as canopy reflectance measurements were
	able to integrate organic nitrogen over total canopy depth. The integration
	of near sensing techniques, theories on the interpretation of reflectance
	signatures and vertical crop nitrogen distribution allowed scaling
	between leaf chlorophyll measurements and canopy nitrogen values.
	This results in more accurate quantification of the nitrogen status
	of a potato crop, which is important information in potato crop management.

	because leaf area is the exchange surface between the photosynthetically

	estimates were obtained from ground truth plot data with known forest
	structure, LAI, and satellite reflectance in the red and near-infrared
	bands (as observed by the Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus

  abstract = {Accurate mapping of secondary forest and the age of these forests
	is critical to assess the carbon budget in tropical regions accurately.
	Using SPOT HRV (High Resolution Visible) data, techniques were developed
	and tested to discriminate primary forest, secondary forest and deforested
	areas on a study site in Rondonia, Brazil. Six co-registered SPOT
	HRV images (1986, 1988, 1989, 1991, 1992 and 1994) were used to create
	a time series of classified images of land cover (primary forest,
	secondary forest and deforested). These trajectories were used to
	identify secondary forest age classes relative to the most recent
	(1994) image. The resultant 1994 map of primary forest, secondary
	forest age classes and deforested areas served as ground reference
	data to establish training and testing sites. Several band 2 and
	3 texture measurements were calculated using a 3 x 3 window to quantify
	canopy homogeneity. Neural networks and linear analysis techniques
	were tested for discriminating between primary forest, secondary
	forest and deforested pixels. The techniques were also employed to
	extract secondary forest age. A neural network using band 3 and a
	texture measure of band 2 and 3 from a single image (1994) discriminated
	primary forest, secondary forest (1 to &gt;9 years) and deforested
	pixel with an average accuracy of 95%. The use of texture information
	increased the secondary forest discrimination accuracy 6.4% (from
	83.5 to 89.9%). Spectral and textural information were also used
	to predict secondary forest age as a continous variable. The neural
	network with the highest accuracy produced a RMSE (predicted network
	age versus actual secondary forest age) of 2.0 years with a coefficient
	of determination (predicted versus true) of 0.38. These results were
	significantly improved by using multitemporal information. The spectral
	and textural information from two images (1994 and 1989) were used
	to extract secondary forest information. The neural network results
	showed that 95.5% of the secondary forest pixels were correctly classified
	as secondary forest pixels (as opposed to 89.9% of the pixels using
	only the 1994 image). The RMSE and R2 accuracies in extracting secondary
	forest age as a continuous variable were 1.3 and 0.75, respectively.
	Using SPOT High Resolution Visible (HRV) data, techniques were developed

	measurements were calculated using a 3×3 window to quantify canopy
	homogeneity. Neural networks and linear analysis techniques were
	tested for discriminating between primary forest, secondary forest
	and deforested pixels. The techniques were also used to extract secondary
	forest age. The results demonstrate that primary forest, secondary
	forest and deforested pixels can be accurately classified using band
	3 and a texture measurement of band 2 and 3 from a single image using

  abstract = {A strong positive correlation between vegetation canopy bidirectional
	reflectance factor (BRF) in the near infrared (NIR) spectral region
	and foliar mass-based nitrogen concentration (%N) has been reported
	in some temperate and boreal forests. This relationship, if true,
	would indicate an additional role for nitrogen in the climate system
	via its influence on surface albedo and may offer a simple approach
	for monitoring foliar nitrogen using satellite data. We report, however,
	that the previously reported correlation is an artifact-it is a consequence
	of variations in canopy structure, rather than of %N. The data underlying
	this relationship were collected at sites with varying proportions
	of foliar nitrogen-poor needleleaf and nitrogen-rich broadleaf species,
	whose canopy structure differs considerably. When the BRF data are
	corrected for canopy-structure effects, the residual reflectance
	variations are negatively related to %N at all wavelengths in the
	interval 423-855 nm. This suggests that the observed positive correlation
	between BRF and %N conveys no information about %N. We find that
	to infer leaf biochemical constituents, e.g., N content, from remotely
	sensed data, BRF spectra in the interval 710-790 nm provide critical
	information for correction of structural influences. Our analysis
	also suggests that surface characteristics of leaves impact remote
	sensing of its internal constituents. This further decreases the
	ability to remotely sense canopy foliar nitrogen. Finally, the analysis
	presented here is generic to the problem of remote sensing of leaf-tissue
	constituents and is therefore not a specific critique of articles
	espousing remote sensing of foliar %N.},

  title = {Towards universal broad leaf chlorophyll indices using {PROSPECT}
	simulated database and hyperspectral reflectance measurements},
  journal = {Remote Sensing of Environment},
  year = {2004},
  volume = {89},
  pages = {1-28},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {Fifty-three leaves were randomly sampled on different deciduous tree
	species, representing a wide range of chlorophyll contents, tree
	ages, and leaf structural features. Their reflectance was measured
	between 400 and 800 nm with a 1-nm step, and their chlorophyll content
	determined by extraction. A larger simulated database (11,583 spectra)
	was built using the PROSPECT model, in order to test, calibrate,
	and obtain universal indices, i.e., indices applicable to a wide
	range of species and leaf structure. To our knowledge, almost all
	leaf chlorophyll indices published in the literature since 1973 have
	been tested on both databases. Fourteen canonical types of indices
	(published ones and new ones) were identified, and their wavelengths
	calibrated on the simulated database as well as on the experimental
	database to determine the best wavelengths and, hence, the best performances
	in chlorophyll estimation for each index types. These indices go
	from simple reflectance ratios to more sophisticated indices using
	reflectance first derivatives (using the Savitzky and Golay method).
	We also tested other nondestructive methods to obtain total chlorophyll
	concentration: SPAD (Minolta Camera, Osaka, Japan) and neural networks.
	The validity of the actual PROSPECT model is challenged by our results:
	Important discordances are found when the indices are calculated
	with PROSPECT compared to experimental data, especially for some
	indices and wavelengths. The discordance is even greater when the
	indices are determined with PROSPECT and applied on the experimental
	database. A new calibration of PROSPECT is therefore necessary for
	any study aiming at using simulated spectra to determine or to calibrate
	indices. The "peak jump" and the multiple-peak feature observed on
	the first derivative of the reflectances (e.g., in the Red-Edge Inflection
	Point [REIP] index) has been investigated. It was shown that chlorophyll
	absorption alone can explain this feature. The peak jump disqualifies
	the REIP to be a valuable chlorophyll index. A simple modified difference
	ratio gave the best results among all published indices (cross-validated
	RMSE=2.1 μg/cm2 on the experimental database). After calibration
	on the experimental database, modified Simple Ratio (mSR) and modified
	Normalized Difference (mND) indices gave the best performances (RMSECV=1.8
	μg/cm2 on the experimental database). The new Double Difference
	(DD) index, although not the best on the experimental database (RMSECV=2.9
	μg/cm2), has the best results on the larger simulated database (RMSE=3.7
	μg/cm2) and is expected to give good results on larger experimental
	databases. The best reflectance-based indices give better performances
	than the current commercial nondestructive device SPAD (RMSECV=4.5
	μg/cm2). In this leaf-level study, the best indices are very near
	from each other, so that complex methods are useless: REIP-like,
	neural networks, and derivative-based indices are not necessary and
	give worst results than simpler properly chosen indices. These conclusions
	will certainly be different for a canopy-level study, where the derivative-based
	indices may perform significantly better than the other ones. ©

  abstract = {Snow/ice albedo is a critical variable in surface energy balance calculations.
	The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data have
	been used routinely to provide global land surface albedo. The MODIS
	algorithm includes atmospheric correction, surface reflectance angular
	modeling, and narrowband to broadband albedo conversion. In an earlier
	study, a "direct retrieval" methodology was proposed to calculate
	instantaneous albedo, over snow and ice-covered surfaces directly
	from top-of-atmosphere (TOA) MODIS reflectance data. The method consists
	of extensive radiative transfer simulations for a variety of atmospheric
	and surface snow conditions and links the TOA reflectance with surface
	broadband albedo through regression analysis. Therefore the direct
	retrieval algorithm implicitly incorporates in a single step all
	three procedures used in the standard MODIS surface albedo algorithm.
	This study presents improvements to the retrieval algorithm including
	validation with in situ measurements distributed over the Greenland
	ice sheet. Comparison with surface observations demonstrates that
	the direct retrieval algorithm can produce very accurate daily snow/ice
	albedo with mean bias of less than 0.02 and residual standard error
	of 0.04. Copyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.},

	green leaves comprise the blue (F440) and green (F520) fluorescence
	bands as well as the red (F690) and far-red (F740) chlorophyll fluorescence
	emission bands. Based on the four UV-laser induced fluorescence bands
	blue, green, red and far-red a high resolution fluorescence imaging
	system was established, which allows a fast and large scale screening
	of fluorescence gradients and local disturbances in fluorescence
	emission over the whole leaf surface. The new imaging method not
	only permits to screen leaves by means of images in four fluorescence
	bands (LIF images) but, in addition, via images of the fluorescence
	ratios blue/red (F440/F690), blue/far-red (F440/F740), the chlorophyll
	fluorescence ratio red/far-red (F690/F740) and the ratio blue/green
	(F440/F520) (LIF ratio images). By fluorescence imaging we could
	prove that in aurea tobacco the major part of the leaves' blue and
	green fluorescence is emitted from the main and side leave veins,
	whereas the major part of the leaves' red and far-red chlorophyll
	fluorescence is emitted from the vein-free leaf regions, which also
	have the highest chlorophyll content. A smaller proportion of the
	aurea tobacco leaves' blue- green fluorescence emission is derived
	from the cell walls of epidermis cells. The fluorescence ratios blue/red
	and blue/far-red are very sensitive to environmental changes, and
	thus permit early stress and strain detection in plants, and the
	evaluation of damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. Via monitoring
	the increase in chlorophyll fluorescence LIF images allow to detect
	differences in the time-dependent uptake of diuron and the progressing
	inhibition of photosynthetic electron transport in the treated leaf
	part. The novel fluorescence imaging technique sets a new dimension
	for early stress detection in the photosynthetic apparatus and in
	plants. It has many advantages over the previously applied point-data
	measurements of selected leaf points using conventional spectrofluorometers.
	The new fluorescence imaging system proved to be very suitable for
	remote sensing of plants in the near distance, and can be further
	developed for far distance remote sensing of the state of health
	of terrestrial vegetation. Some examples in the many possible ways
	of computer-aided fluorescence data processing (formation of different
	fluorescence ratios, screening of fluorescence profiles, histogramme
	plotting) are indicated.},

	gdry matter msoil- 2). These parameters are useful inputs for forest
	ecosystem simulations at landscape scale. The method is based on
	the determination of the best vegetation indices (index form and
	wavelengths) using the radiative transfer model PROSAIL (formed by
	the newly-calibrated leaf reflectance model PROSPECT coupled with
	the multi-layer version of the canopy radiative transfer model SAIL).
	The results are tested on experimental measurements at both leaf
	and canopy scales. At the leaf scale, it is possible to estimate
	CHL with high precision using a two wavelength vegetation index after
	a simulation based calibration. At the leaf scale, the LMA is more
	difficult to estimate with indices. At the canopy scale, efficient
	indices were determined on a generic simulated database to estimate
	CHL, LMA, LAI and Bleaf in a general way. These indices were then
	applied to two Hyperion images (50 plots) on the Fontainebleau and
	Fougères forests and portable spectroradiometer measurements. They
	showed good results with an RMSE of 8.2 μg cm- 2 for CHL, 9.1 g
	m- 2 for LMA, 1.7 m2 m- 2 for LAI and 50.6 g m- 2 for Bleaf. However,
	at the canopy scale, even if the wavelengths of the calibrated indices
	were accurately determined with the simulated database, the regressions
	between the indices and the biophysical characteristics still had
	to be calibrated on measurements. At the canopy scale, the best indices
	were: for leaf chlorophyll content: NDchl = (\CF?925 - \CF?710)/(\CF?925
	+ \CF?710), for leaf mass per area: NDLMA = (\CF?2260 - \CF?1490)/(\CF?2260

  abstract = {The use of remote sensing is necessary for monitoring forest carbon
	stocks at large scales. Optical remote sensing, although not the
	most suitable technique for the direct estimation of stand biomass,
	offers the advantage of providing large temporal and spatial datasets.
	In particular, information on canopy structure is encompassed in
	stand reflectance time series. This study focused on the example
	of Eucalyptus forest plantations, which have recently attracted much
	attention as a result of their high expansion rate in many tropical
	countries. Stand scale time-series of Normalized Difference Vegetation
	Index (NDVI) were obtained from MODIS satellite data after a procedure
	involving un-mixing and interpolation, on about 15,000ha of plantations
	in southern Brazil. The comparison of the planting date of the current
	rotation (and therefore the age of the stands) estimated from these
	time series with real values provided by the company showed that
	the root mean square error was 35.5days. Age alone explained more
	than 82% of stand wood volume variability and 87% of stand dominant
	height variability. Age variables were combined with other variables
	derived from the NDVI time series and simple bioclimatic data by
	means of linear (Stepwise) or nonlinear (Random Forest) regressions.
	The nonlinear regressions gave r-square values of 0.90 for volume
	and 0.92 for dominant height, and an accuracy of about 25m3/ha for
	volume (15% of the volume average value) and about 1.6m for dominant
	height (8% of the height average value). The improvement including
	NDVI and bioclimatic data comes from the fact that the cumulative
	NDVI since planting date integrates the interannual variability of
	leaf area index (LAI), light interception by the foliage and growth
	due for example to variations of seasonal water stress. The accuracy
	of biomass and height predictions was strongly improved by using
	the NDVI integrated over the two first years after planting, which
	are critical for stand establishment. These results open perspectives
	for cost-effective monitoring of biomass at large scales in intensively-managed

  abstract = {We investigate combined continuum removal and radiative transfer (RT)
	modeling to retrieve leaf chlorophyll a &amp; b content (Cab) from
	the AISA Eagle airborne imaging spectrometer data of sub-meter (0.4
	m) spatial resolution. Based on coupled PROSPECT-DART RT simulations
	of a Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stand, we propose a
	new Cab sensitive index located between 650 and 720nm and termed
	ANCB650-720. The performance of ANCB650-720 was validated against
	ground-measured Cab of ten spruce crowns and compared with Cab estimated
	by a conventional artificial neural network (ANN) trained with continuum
	removed RT simulations and also by three previously published chlorophyll
	optical indices: normalized difference between reflectance at 925
	and 710nm (ND925&amp;710), simple reflectance ratio between 750 and
	710nm (SR750/710) and the ratio of TCARI/OSAVI indices. Although
	all retrieval methods produced visually comparable Cab spatial patterns,
	the ground validation revealed that the ANCB650-720 and ANN retrievals
	are more accurate than the other three chlorophyll indices (R2=0.72
	for both methods). ANCB650-720 estimated Cab with an RMSE=2.27μgcm-2
	(relative RRMSE=4.35%) and ANN with an RMSE=2.18μgcm-2 (RRMSE=4.18%),
	while SR750/710 with an RMSE=4.16μgcm-2 (RRMSE=7.97%), ND925&amp;710
	with an RMSE=9.07μgcm-2 (RRMSE=17.38%) and TCARI/OSAVI with an RMSE=12.30μgcm-2
	(RRMSE=23.56%). Also the systematic RMSES was lower than the unsystematic
	one only for the ANCB650-720 and ANN retrievals. Our results indicate
	that the newly proposed index can provide the same accuracy as ANN
	except for Cab values below 30μgcm-2, which are slightly overestimated
	(RMSE=2.42μgcm-2). The computationally efficient ANCB650-720 retrieval
	provides accurate high spatial resolution airborne Cab maps, considerable
	as a suitable reference data for validating satellite-based Cab products.

	of this study is to improve the LAI estimated from the Physiological

	with LAI derived from Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection
	Radiometer (ASTER) satellite imagery. A {B}ayesian network (BN) approach

	introduced into BN to estimate missing the LAI ASTER data, since
	they are not available for long time series due to the atmospheric
	conditions. This paper shows that the outputs obtained with the BN
	were more accurate than the 3-PG estimate, as the root mean square
	error reduces to 0.46, and the relative error to 5.86 percent. We
	conclude that the EM-algorithm within a BN can adequately handle

  abstract = {Pasture qualilty, expressed as a percentage of total digestible nutrients
	(nitrogen, potassium, phosphorous, calcium and magnesium), is a major
	factor determining the grazing patterns of wildlife and livestock.
	Existing rangeland monitoring techniques seldom reflect the nutritive
	quality of the pastures and are consequently of limited value in
	explaining animal distribution. Techniques that can estimate pasture
	quality on a large scale are therefore critical in understanding
	and explaining wildlife and livestock distribution. We present the
	results of a greenhouse experiment designed to estimate the concentrations
	of nitrogen, potassium, phosphorous, calcium, magnesium and non-detergent
	fibre (NDF), using the reflectance of a tropical grass (Cenchrus
	ciliaris) canopy. Canopy spectral measurements were taken under controlled
	laboratory conditions using a GER 3700 spectroradiometer. We tested
	the utility of using the band depth analysis methodology in the visible
	region (where water absorption is less effective) to estimate foliar
	chemistry in fresh canopies. Continuum removal was applied to the
	visible absorption feature centred at 670 nm, and band depth ratios
	(BDRs) were calculated. Stepwise linear regression was used to select
	wavelengths from calculated BDRs that were highly correlated with
	foliar chemistry in a randomly selected training dataset. The resulting
	regression models were used to predict foliar chemistry in a test
	dataset. Results indicate that stepwise regression on bands calculated
	from continuum-removed reflectance spectra could predict foliar nutrient
	concentration with high accuracy. The correlations were highest for
	magnesium and nitrogen (R 2=0.77 and 0.73 respectively, using the
	normalized band depth index (NBDI)) between the measured and estimated
	biochemicals-a satisfactory result in estimating foliar chemistry
	in fresh standing pastures. With the advent of new sensors such as
	Hymap and MERIS, these results lay the basis for developing algorithms
	to rapidly estimate and ultimately map pasture quality in tropical
	rangelands. © 2005 Taylor &amp; Francis Ltd.},

  abstract     = {The terrestrial biosphere is a key regulator of atmospheric chemistry and climate. During past periods of climate change, vegetation cover and interactions between the terrestrial biosphere and atmosphere changed within decades. Modern observations show a similar responsiveness of terrestrial biogeochemistry to anthropogenically forced climate change and air pollution. Although interactions between the carbon cycle and climate have been a central focus, other biogeochemical feedbacks could be as important in modulating future climate change. Total positive radiative forcings resulting from feedbacks between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere are estimated to reach up to 0.9 or 1.5 W m(-2) K-1 towards the end of the twenty-first century, depending on the extent to which interactions with the nitrogen cycle stimulate or limit carbon sequestration. This substantially reduces and potentially even eliminates the cooling effect owing to carbon dioxide fertilization of the terrestrial biota. The overall magnitude of the biogeochemical feedbacks could potentially be similar to that of feedbacks in the physical climate system, but there are large uncertainties in the magnitude of individual estimates and in accounting for synergies between these effects.},

	and essential role because of its ability to acquire synoptic information

	a two-year field and laboratory study with the new airborne hyperspectral
	sensor, the Airborne Visible near Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIS),
	over a test site in the Bavarian Alpine foothills, Germany (48°8′
	N, 11° 17′ E). The 80-band AVIS was developed at the Department
	for Earth and Environmental Sciences of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University
	Munich and records the 550-1000nm spectral range. Using this system,
	18 hyperspectral datasets were collected between April and September
	of 1999 and 2000. Weekly measurements of several plant parameters
	(height, biomass, leaf chlorophyll content, leaf nitrogen content)
	were carried out during these time periods on three (1999) and six
	(2000) fields of winter wheat, whereby two different cultivars were
	investigated in 2000. After system correction and calibration, the
	hyperspectral data were atmospherically corrected and calibrated
	to reflectance. The resulting spectra were analysed for their chemical
	compounds. The statistical analysis was carried out using the Chlorophyll
	Absorption Integral (CAI) in comparison to established indices: Optimized
	Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) and hyperspectral Normalized
	Difference Vegetation Index (hNDVI). Both the chlorophyll and nitrogen
	content of the leaves showed good correlations with CAI on a field
	mean basis. These results as well as two-dimensional information
	on these parameters are presented to provide information about the
	spatial heterogeneity within a field.},

  abstract = {We tested the potential of artificial neural networks (ANNs) as predictive
	tools in ecology. We compared the performance of ANNs and regression
	models (RM) in predicting ecosystems attributes. with special emphasis
	on temporal (interannual) predictions of functional attributes of
	the ecosystem at regional scales. We tested the predictive power
	of ANNs and RMs using simulated data for six functional traits derived
	from the seasonal course of the normalized difference vegetation
	index (NDVI): the annual integral of the NDVI curve (NDVI-I), the
	maximum (MAX) and minimum (MIN) NDVI, the date of the MAX NDVI (DM)
	and the date of start (SGS) and end (EGS) of the growing season.
	For one of these traits (NDVI-I), we also generated a set of data
	that incorporated the effects of the state of the system in previous
	years (inertial effects). Even simple non-linearities in the actual
	functional form of the relationship between environmental variables
	and ecosystem attributes preclude a precise prediction of these attributes
	when the rules are not explicit. That was evident for predictions
	based on both ANNs and RMs under absolutely deterministic conditions
	(error-free scenario). Non-linearities in the simulated traits of
	the NDVI curve derive from multiplicative terms in the models. Under
	the presence of these non-linear terms, a different aggregation of
	the driving variables (monthly vs. annual or quarterly climatic data)
	reduce substantially the ability of both RMs and ANNs to predict
	the independent variable. For the six traits analyzed, the ANNs were
	able to make better predictions than RMs. The correlation between
	observed and predicted values of each of the six traits considered
	was higher for the ANNs than for the RMs. ANNs showed clear advantages
	to capture inertial effects. The ANN used was able to use previous
	year information on climate to estimate current year NDVI-1 much
	better than the RM that used the same input information.},

  abstract = {This study compares the performance of radiative transfer model inversion
	techniques to estimate leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) from summer
	barley based on hyperspectral data. The PROSAIL model was used to
	simulate vegetation reflectances. Model performance was tested against
	168 ASD measurements taken under controlled conditions in an experimental

	the PROSAIL model. A new and efficient method for LUT generation
	is presented which serves also as an extensive data basis to train

  abstract = {Leaf area index (LAI) products retrieved from remote sensing observations
	have been widely used in the fields of ecosphere, atmosphere etc.
	However, because satellite-observed images are captured instantaneously
	and sometimes screened by cloud, some current LAI products are inherently
	discontinuous in time and their accuracy may not meet the needs of
	users well. To solve these problems, we proposed a dynamic {B}ayesian
	network (DBN)-based data fusion algorithm that integrates dynamic
	crop growth information, a canopy reflectance (CR) model and remote
	sensing observations from the perspective of {B}ayesian probability.
	Using the proposed algorithm, LAI was estimated using data sets from
	both field measurements for winter wheat in Beijing, China, and MODIS
	reflectance data at two American flux tower sites. Results showed
	good agreement between the LAI estimated by the DBN-based data fusion
	method and the true ground LAI, with a correlation coefficient of
	(R) 0.95 and 0.96, respectively, and a corresponding root mean square
	error (RMSE) of 0.35 and 0.49, respectively. In addition, the LAI
	estimated by the DBN-based data fusion method formed a continuous
	time series and was consistent with the variety law of vegetation
	growth at both plot and flux tower site scales. It has been demonstrated
	that the proposed DBN-based data fusion algorithm has the potential
	to be used to accurately estimate LAI and to fill the temporal gap
	by integrating information from multiple sources. © 2012 Copyright

  pages = {639-651},
  abstract = {Incorporation of a priori defined plant associations into remote sensing
	products is a major challenge that has only recently been confronted
	by the remote sensing community. We present an approach to map the
	spatial distribution of such associations by using plant indicator
	values (IVs) for salinity, moisture and nutrients as an intermediate
	between spectral reflectance and association occurrences. For a 12km2
	study site in the Netherlands, the relations between observed IVs
	at local vegetation plots and visible and near-infrared (VNIR) and
	short-wave infrared (SWIR) airborne reflectance data were modelled
	using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) (R2 0.73, 0.64 and 0.76 for
	salinity, moisture and nutrients, respectively). These relations
	were applied to map IVs for the complete study site. Association
	occurrence probabilities were modelled as function of IVs using a
	large database of vegetation plots with known association and IVs.
	Using the mapped IVs, we calculated occurrence probabilities of 19
	associations for each pixel, resulting in both a crisp association
	map with the most likely occurring association per pixel, as well
	as occurrence probability maps per association. Association occurrence
	predictions were assessed by a local vegetation expert, which revealed
	that the occurrences of associations situated at frequently predicted
	indicator value combinations were over predicted. This seems primarily
	due to biases in the GPR predicted IVs, resulting in associations
	with envelopes located in extreme ends of IVs being scarcely predicted.Although
	the results of this particular study were not fully satisfactory,
	the method potentially offers several advantages compared to current
	vegetation classification techniques, like site-independent calibration
	of association probabilities, site-independent selection of associations
	and the provision of IV maps and occurrence probabilities per association.
	If the prediction of IVs can be improved, this method may thus provide
	a viable roadmap to bring a priori defined plant associations into
	the domain of remote sensing. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

	canopy water content (CWC). The estimates were calibrated and validated
	using water retrievals from AVIRIS data from study sites located
	around the United States that included a wide range of environmental
	conditions. The ANN algorithm showed good performance across different
	vegetation types, with high correlations and consistent determination
	coefficients. The approach outperformed a multiple linear regression
	approach used to independently retrieve the same variable. The calibrated
	algorithm was then applied at the MODIS 500 m scale to follow changes
	in CWC for the year 2005 across the continental United States, subdivided
	into three vegetation types (grassland, shrubland, and forest). The
	ANN estimates of CWC correlated well with rainfall, indicating a
	strong ecological response. The high correlations suggest that the
	inversion of RTM through an ANN provide a realistic basis for multi-temporal
	assessments of CWC over wide areas for continental and global studies.

	early in Earth history and have been stable for 2.5 billion years,
	providing prima facie evidence for the significance of pigments in
	plant functions. Photosynthetic pigments fill multiple roles from
	increasing the range of energy captured for photosynthesis to protective
	functions. Given the importance of pigments to leaf functioning,
	greater effort is needed to determine whether individual pigments
	can be identified and quantified in vivo using high fidelity spectroscopy.
	We review recent advances in detecting plant pigments at the leaf
	level and discuss successes and reasons why challenges remain for
	robust remote observation and quantification. New methods to identify
	and quantify individual pigments in the presence of overlapping absorption
	features would provide a major advance in understanding their biological
	functions, quantifying net carbon exchange, and identifying plant
	stresses. © 2009.},

	the basis of several operational algorithms to estimate canopy biophysical

	evaluated over both actual experimental observations and model simulations.
	The SAIL and PROSPECT radiative transfer models were used here to
	simulate the training and the synthetic test datasets. Measurements
	of LAI, FCOVER and FAPAR were achieved over the Barrax (Spain) agricultural
	site for a range of crop types concurrently to CHRIS/PROBA satellite
	image acquisition. Results showed that the spectral band selection
	was specific to LAI, FCOVER and FAPAR variables. The optimal band
	set provided significantly improved performances for LAI, while only
	small differences were observed for the other variables. Gaussian
	distributions of the radiative transfer model input variables performed
	better than uniform distributions for which no prior information
	was exploited. Including moderate uncertainties in the reflectance
	simulations used in the training process improved the flexibility
	of the neural network in cases where simulations departed slightly
	from observations. Simple neural network architecture with a single
	hidden layer of five tangent sigmoid transfer functions was performing
	as good as more complex architectures if the training dataset was
	larger than ten times the number of coefficients to tune. Small sensitivity
	of performances was observed depending on the way the solution was
	selected when several networks were trained in parallel. Finally,
	comparison with a NDVI based approach showed the generally better

	(Chl) is crucial to adequately interpret the chlorophyll fluorescence
	(ChF) signal from space. Accompanying information about the reliability
	of the Chl estimation becomes more important than ever. Recently,
	a new statistical method was proposed within the family of nonparametric
	{B}ayesian statistics, namely Gaussian Processes regression (GPR).
	GPR is simpler and more robust than their machine learning family
	members while maintaining very good numerical performance and stability.
	Other features include: i) GPR requires a relatively small training
	data set and can adopt very flexible kernels, ii) GPR identifies
	the relevant bands and observations in establishing relationships
	with a variable, and finally iii) along with pixelwise estimations
	GPR provides accompanying confidence intervals. We used GPR to retrieve
	Chl from hyperspectral reflectance data and evaluated the portability
	of the regression model to other images. Based on field Chl measurements
	from the SPARC dataset and corresponding spaceborne CHRIS spectra
	(acquired in 2003, Barrax, Spain), GPR developed a regression model
	that was excellently validated (r2: 0.96, RMSE: 3.82 \mu{\rm g/cm}2
	). The SPARC-trained GPR model was subsequently applied to CHRIS
	images (Barrax, 2003, 2009) and airborne CASI flightlines (Barrax
	2009) to generate Chl maps. The accompanying confidence maps provided
	insight in the robustness of the retrievals. Similar confidences
	were achieved by both sensors, which is encouraging for upscaling
	Chl estimates from field to landscape scale. Because of its robustness
	and ability to deliver confidence intervals, GPR is evaluated as
	a promising candidate for implementation into ChF processing chains.

  abstract = {ESA's upcoming Sentinel-2 (S2) Multispectral Instrument (MSI) foresees
	to provide continuity to land monitoring services by relying on optical
	payload with visible, near infrared and shortwave infrared sensors
	with high spectral, spatial and temporal resolution. This unprecedented
	data availability leads to an urgent need for developing robust and
	accurate retrieval methods, which ideally should provide uncertainty
	intervals for the predictions. Statistical learning regression algorithms
	are powerful candidats for the estimation of biophysical parameters
	from satellite reflectance measurements because of their ability
	to perform adaptive, nonlinear data fitting. In this paper, we focus
	on a new emerging technique in the field of {B}ayesian nonparametric
	modeling. We exploit Gaussian process regression (GPR) for retrieval,
	which is an accurate method that also provides uncertainty intervals
	along with the mean estimates. This distinct feature is not shared
	by other machine learning approaches. In view of implementing the
	regressor into operational monitoring applications, here the portability
	of locally trained GPR models was evaluated. Experimental data came
	from the ESA-led field campaign SPARC (Barrax, Spain). For various
	simulated S2 configurations (S2-10m, S2-20m and S2-60m) two important
	biophysical parameters were estimated: leaf chlorophyll content (LCC)
	and leaf area index (LAI). Local evaluation of an extended training
	dataset with more variation over bare soil sites led to improved
	LCC and LAI mapping with reduced uncertainties. GPR reached the 10%
	precision required by end users, with for LCC a NRMSE of 3.5-9.2%
	(r2: 0.95-0.99) and for LAI a NRMSE of 6.5-7.3% (r2: 0.95-0.96).
	The developed GPR models were subsequently applied to simulated Sentinel
	images over various sites. The associated uncertainty maps proved
	to be a good indicator for evaluating the robustness of the retrieval
	performance. The generally low uncertainty intervals over vegetated
	surfaces suggest that the locally trained GPR models are portable
	to other sites and conditions. © 2013 International Society for

  pages = {208-221},
  abstract = {Species richness increases markedly during the first years after fire,
	driven mainly by the increase in the number of herbaceous species.
	However, such increase is variable in space and time, due to the
	role that the different plant life-forms can play after the fire
	disturbance. In addition, the absence of reliable species richness
	information can be a limitation for decision making when postfire
	management actions are needed. In this study we used QuickBird imagery
	to develop multiscale, spatially explicit predictive models of species
	richness in a burned area 1year after a fire. The study area is an
	abandoned dehesa (a Quercus suber (cork oak) open woodland with shrubs)
	of central Spain, which had been affected by a large summer fire.
	Two 90×180m macroplots were established, where species richness
	and percentage cover of various plant life-forms were measured at
	three spatial scales (1, 25, and 100m 2). Total plant species richness
	was related to reflectance and spectral contrast derived from the
	multispectral bands of QuickBird and to the Normalized Difference
	Vegetation Index (NDVI), by using regression tree analysis (RTA)
	and boosted regression trees (BRT). Furthermore, for the biophysical
	support of such models, plant species richness was related to field-based
	compositional data, and life-form percentage cover to satellite data.
	Results indicated that the relationship between species richness,
	reflectance and spectral contrast was strong and scale-dependent
	(1m 2: adjusted R 2=0.50; 25m 2: adj. R 2=0.65; 100m 2: adj. R 2=0.79),
	whereas NDVI played a minor role at all scales. At the finest sampling
	scale, a low range of species richness was related to a high variability
	of spectral and texture responses, due to the excess of spatial detail
	of the pixel size. At 25m 2, a higher range of species richness was
	related to a low variability of spectral and texture responses; this
	was probably due to the fact that the sampling size only captured
	certain portions of plant individuals or life-form associations.
	At the largest sampling scale (100m 2), the highest variability of
	species richness was adequately related to the spectral and texture
	responses, due to the spatial fit between the sampling plot size
	and both the pixel- and plant-sizes. Species richness was closely
	linked to life-form percentage cover (mainly to herbaceous plant
	cover), and life-form cover was adequately explained by satellite
	data, giving a biophysical support to our predictive models. Reflectance
	and spectral contrast were good predictive tools of total plant species
	richness at the largest sampling scale, but their predictive power
	diminished at the smaller scales. This was explained by the range
	of species richness measured at each scale, the spatial arrangement
	of species, and the ratio of the spatial resolution (both for pixels
	from satellite data and for ground sampling plots) to the size of
	the objects. These results contribute to improve our knowledge about
	the link between high spatial resolution remotely sensed data and
	species richness at different sampling scales. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {This study describes the retrieval of state variables (LAI, canopy
	chlorophyll, water and dry matter contents) for summer barley from
	airborne HyMap data by means of a canopy reflectance model (PROSPECT
	+ SAIL). Three different inversion techniques were applied to explore
	the impact of the employed method on estimation accuracies: numerical
	optimization (downhill simplex method), a lookup table (LUT) and
	an artificial neural network (ANN) approach. By numerical optimization
	(Num Opt), reliable estimates were obtained for LAI and canopy chlorophyll
	contents (LAI × Cab) with r2 of 0.85 and 0.94 and RDP values of
	1.81 and 2.65, respectively. Accuracies dropped for canopy water
	(LAI × Cw) and dry matter contents (LAI × Cm). Nevertheless, the
	range of leaf water contents (Cw) was very narrow in the studied
	plant material. Prediction accuracies generally decreased in the
	order Num Opt &gt; LUT &gt; ANN. This decrease in accuracy mainly
	resulted from an increase in offset in the obtained values, as the
	retrievals from the different approaches were highly correlated.
	The same decreasing order in accuracy was found for the difference
	between the measured spectra and those reconstructed from the retrieved
	variable values. The parallel application of the different inversion
	techniques to one collective data set was helpful to identify modelling
	uncertainties, as shortcomings of the retrieval algorithms themselves
	could be separated from uncertainties in model structure and parameterisation
	schemes. © 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {This paper follows previous research that identified 15 hyperspectral
	wavebands that were suitable to estimate paddy rice leaf area index
	(LAI). The objectives of the study were to: (1) test the efficiency
	of the wavebands selected in the previous study, (2) to evaluate
	the potential of least squares support vector machines (LS-{SVM}) to
	estimate paddy rice LAI from canopy hyperspectral reflectance and
	(3) to compare multiple linear regression-MLR, partial least squares-PLS
	regression and LS-{SVM} to determine paddy rice LAI using the selected
	wavebands. In the study, measurements of hyperspectral reflectance
	(350-2500 nm) and corresponding LAI were made for a paddy rice canopy
	throughout the growing seasons. On the basis of the wavebands selected
	previously, models based on MLR, PLS and LS-{SVM} to estimate rice
	LAI were compared using the data from 123 observations, which were
	split randomly for model calibration (2/3) and validation (1/3).
	Root mean square errors (RMSEs) and the correlation coefficients
	(r) between measured and predicted LAI values from model calibration
	and validation were calculated to evaluate the quality of the models.
	The results showed that the LS-{SVM} model using the 15 selected wavebands
	produced more accurate estimates of paddy rice LAI than the PLS and
	MLR models. We concluded that the LS-{SVM} approach may provide a useful
	exploratory and predictive tool for estimating paddy rice LAI when
	applied to reflectance data using the 15 selected wavebands. © 2010

  abstract = {Large areas of forest in the US and Canada are affected by insects
	and disease each year. Over the past century, outbreaks of the Eastern
	spruce budworm have become more frequent and severe. The notion of
	designing a more pest resistant landscape through prescriptive management
	practices hinges on our ability to effectively model forest-insect
	dynamics at regional scales. Increasingly, more detailed pixel-wise
	estimates of forest biophysical parameters are needed for such endeavors.
	Lidar technology, although promising, is not yet viable for repeated
	regional accounting, necessitating the development of methods which
	take advantage of existing spaceborne assets. Our objective is to
	use one of these assets (SPOT-5) to estimate a large set of forest
	structural attributes at a finer spatial grain size (5 m and 10 m)
	over a broader area than is currently available for the purpose of
	supplying needed input data for disturbance simulation modeling.
	We employ neighborhood statistics (standard deviation, variance,
	sill variance, and ratios of these metrics at 5 and 10 m) calculated
	from SPOT-5 sensor data and derivatives to estimate and map tree
	canopy diameter (CDIA), bole diameter at breast height (DBH), tree
	height (HT), crown closure (CC), vertical length of live crown (LC),
	and basal area (BA). A partial least squares (PLS) regression approach
	was used with these local statistics and field data to produce models
	for pixel-wise estimation and mapping of mean values, respectively,
	for hardwood and coniferous forest CDIA (R2 = 0.82 and 0.93, RMSE
	0.62 and 0.47 m), DBH (R2 = 0.82 and 0.90, RMSE 2.92 and 3.75 cm),
	HT (R2 = 0.69 and 0.92, RMSE 1.27 and 1.59 m), CC (R2 = 0.52 and
	0.68, RMSE 5.49 and 6.02%), LC (R2 = 0.58 and 0.81, RMSE 0.96 and
	1.25 m), and BA (R2 = 0.71 and 0.74, RMSE 2.47 and 4.58 m2 ha-
	1) for a 3600 km2 area in northeast Minnesota. This approach for
	quantifying forest structure is robust in the sense that a detailed
	forest cover type map is not required to stratify analysis at any
	step in the process. Hence, we show that multi-resolution SPOT-5
	data are a practical alternative to lidar for regional characterization
	of forest biophysical parameters. However, lidar data may potentially
	be used to calibrate these SPOT-based structure models in the future.

	To accurately determine the corn LAI, several methods of LAI estimation
	have been evaluated in this investigation, including vegetation indices,
	principal component analysis (PCA), the neural network method (NN),
	the look-up table (LUT) inversion from PROSAIL model and the Hybrid
	model. Comparisons were conducted based on field-measured corn canopy
	hyperspectral reflectance and LAI data over northeastern China. In
	order to fairly compare the LAI estimation performance of different
	methods, the groundmeasured data were separated into two sets (modeling
	data and validation data), except the LUT and hybrid methods of PROSAIL-based.
	The results indicated that the PCA method delivered the best performance
	for corn LAI estimation (with maximum R2 = 0.814 and minimum RMSE
	= 0.501) in this study. The hybrid model and EVI provided moderate
	results. Comparatively, the LUT and NN methods were less successful
	and NDVI provided the worst corn LAI estimation performance in this
	study. The PCA method shows great potential for performing well on
	corn LAI estimation from hyperspectral information. PCA can avoid
	the reflectance saturation defect of dense canopy in a certain extent,
	can utilize hyperspectral reflectance data much more effectively
	than other methods, and is not limited by the band numbers, it can
	also reduce noise and provide an great correlation with LAI from

  abstract = {This paper presents a new forest leaf area index (LAI) inversion method
	from multisource and multiangle data combined with a radiative transfer
	model and the strategy of k-means clustering and artificial neural
	network (ANN). Four scenes of Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (L5TM) and
	Beijing-1 small satellite multispectral sensors (BJ1) images, acquired
	at different times, were selected to construct multisource and multiangle
	image data in this study. Considering a vertical distribution of
	forest LAI from both overstory and understory, a hybrid model of
	the invertible forest reflectance model (INFORM) was used to support
	the retrieval of forest LAI to eliminate the dependence of understory
	vegetation. The simulated data from INFORM outputs, added with a
	random noise, were first clustered by k-means method, and were then
	trained by ANN to obtain the inversion model for each group (cluster).
	Next, the inversion model was applied to the different combinations
	of multiangle data to retrieve the forest LAI. Finally, a validation
	of inverted results with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
	LAI product and field measurements was conducted. The experimental
	results indicate that the accuracy of the inverted forest LAI can
	be improved through the addition of observation angle data, if the
	quality of the image data is ensured. The inversion accuracy of LAI
	with the multiangle image data is improved by 30% compared to the
	average accuracy of the inverted LAI with the single angle data after
	considering the addition of random noise to the ANN training data.

  abstract = {Recent advances in spectral imaging technology have enabled the development
	of models that estimate various crop parameters from spectral imagery
	data. We developed partial least square (PLS) models to predict fruit
	yield of Satsuma mandarin using airborne hyperspectral imagery obtained
	several months before harvesting. Hyperspectral images in the 72
	visible and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths (from 407 to 898 nm)
	were acquired over a citrus orchard during the early growing seasons

	identified using pixel-based average spectral reflectance values
	for all 72 wavelengths from the acquired images. The acquired canopy
	features were then used as prediction variables to develop yield
	prediction models. These were developed using three techniques: (1)
	normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), simple ratio (SR)
	and photochemical reflectance index (PRI), (2) conventional multiple
	linear regression (MLR) models, and (3) PLS regression models. As
	we intended to predict yield several months before the harvesting
	season (generally late December), the conventional techniques (vegetation
	indices and MLR) did not predict well. In contrast, PLS models gave
	successful predictions for the three years. These results confirmed
	the hypothesized correlation between canopy features and citrus yield.
	The successful forecasting of yields several months or even one year

  abstract = {Alternate bearing is a well-marked yield variability phenomenon that
	occurs in almost all tree-fruit crops. The potential benefits of
	applying various alternate bearing control measures on alternate
	bearing crops can only be realized when yield information on individual
	trees of particular crops is obtained. The objective of this study
	was to examine the potential of airborne hyperspectral imagery to
	estimate the fruit yield in citrus. Hyperspectral images in 72 visible
	and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths (from 407 to 898 nm) were acquired
	over a citrus orchard in Japan by an Airborne Imaging Spectrometer
	for Applications (AISA) Eagle system. The canopy features of individual
	trees were identified using pixel-based average spectral reflectance
	values at various wavelengths from the acquired images, which were
	then used to develop yield prediction models. Yield prediction models
	were developed using five different techniques - (i) several vegetation
	indices (VIs), (ii) key wavelengths determined by simple correlation
	analysis (SCA), (iii) principal components (PCs) based on principal
	component regression (PCR), and (iv) PLS factors as well as (v) important
	wavelengths determined by B-matrix based on partial least squares
	(PLS) regression. The results indicated that the VIs used in this
	study were poorly correlated with fruit yield on individual trees.
	The key or important wavelengths determined by the two methods proposed
	in this study could provide reasonable prediction of fruit yield.
	Comparatively, the B-matrix method based on the PLS regression was
	superior to the simple correlation analysis in determining the key
	or importance wavelengths that are correlated to the fruit yield.
	However, the PCs extracted from the hyperspectral data were weak
	predictors of citrus yield. Greater prediction accuracy was obtained
	with the model based on PLS factors than with the models based on
	the key or important wavelengths. These results confirmed the hypothesized
	correlation between canopy features and citrus yield. The methods
	proposed in this study have considerable promise in estimating fruit
	yield on individual citrus trees. The yield information is valuable
	for planning harvest schedules and developing programs for application
	of tree-specific alternate bearing control measures and other management

	and fluorescence variables. A series of laboratory measurements of
	spectral reflectance at leaf and canopy levels and a modeling study
	were conducted, demonstrating that effects of chlorophyll fluorescence
	(CF) can be detected by remote sensing. The coupled FRT and PROSPECT
	model enabled CF and chlorophyll a + b (C a+b) content to be estimated
	by inversion. Laboratory measurements of leaf reflectance (r) and

	of CF effects on specific fluorescence-sensitive indices calculated
	in the Photosystem I (PS-I) and Photosystem II (PS-II) optical region,
	such as the curvature index [CUR; (R 675·R 690)/R 683 2]. Dark-adapted

	variable to maximal fluorescence (F v/F m), steady state maximal
	fluorescence (F′ m), steady state fluorescence (F 1), and the effective

	(DR) was related to increased CF and C a+b concentration. These results
	were consistent with imagery collected with a compact airborne spectrographic
	imager (CASI) sensor from sites of sugar maple (Acer saccharam Marshall)
	of high and low stress conditions, showing a double peak on canopy
	derivative reflectance in the red-edge spectral region. We developed
	a derivative chlorophyll index (DCI; calculated as D 705/D 722),

  abstract = {Remotely sensed data is the main source of vegetation leaf area index
	(LAI) information on the regional to global scale. Many validation
	results have revealed that the accuracy of the retrieved LAI is often
	affected by the cloud cover of imagery, instrument problems, and
	inversion algorithms. Ground meteorological station data, characterized
	by relatively high accuracy and time continuity compared with remote
	sensing data, can provide complementary information to remote sensing
	observations. In this paper, we combine the potential advantages
	of both types of data in order to improve LAI retrievals in the Heihe
	River Basin, an arid and semi-arid area in northwest China where
	Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI values
	are significantly underestimated. A dynamic {B}ayesian network (DBN)
	is used to integrate these two data types for time series LAI estimation.
	Results show that the square of correlation coefficient between LAI
	values estimated by our DBN method (referred to as DBN LAI) and field
	measured LAI values is 0.76, with a root mean square error of 0.78.
	The DBN LAI are closer to field measurements than the MODIS LAI standard
	product values. Moreover, by introducing ground meteorological station
	data using a dynamic process model, DBN LAI show better temporal
	consistency than the MODIS LAI. It is concluded that the quality
	of LAI retrievals can be improved by combining remote sensing data
	and ground meteorological station data using a filtering inference
	algorithm in a DBN framework. More importantly, the study provides
	a basis and method for utilizing ground meteorological station network
	data to estimate land surface parameters on a regional scale. ©

@article{Allen09,
    abstract = {Global efforts to mitigate climate change are guided by projections of future temperatures1. But the eventual equilibrium global mean temperature associated with a given stabilization level of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations remains uncertain1, 2, 3, complicating the setting of stabilization targets to avoid potentially dangerous levels of global warming4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Similar problems apply to the carbon cycle: observations currently provide only a weak constraint on the response to future emissions9, 10, 11. Here we use ensemble simulations of simple climate-carbon-cycle models constrained by observations and projections from more comprehensive models to simulate the temperature response to a broad range of carbon dioxide emission pathways. We find that the peak warming caused by a given cumulative carbon dioxide emission is better constrained than the warming response to a stabilization scenario. Furthermore, the relationship between cumulative emissions and peak warming is remarkably insensitive to the emission pathway (timing of emissions or peak emission rate). Hence policy targets based on limiting cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide are likely to be more robust to scientific uncertainty than emission-rate or concentration targets. Total anthropogenic emissions of one trillion tonnes of carbon (3.67 trillion tonnes of {CO2}), about half of which has already been emitted since industrialization began, results in a most likely peak carbon-dioxide-induced warming of 2 °C above pre-industrial temperatures, with a 5–95\% confidence interval of 1.3–3.9 °C.},

Using forest inventory data and long-term ecosystem carbon studies, we estimate a total forest sink of 2.4 ± 0.4 petagrams of carbon per year (Pg C year–1) globally for 1990 to 2007. We also estimate a source of 1.3 ± 0.7 Pg C year–1 from tropical land-use change, consisting of a gross tropical deforestation emission of 2.9 ± 0.5 Pg C year–1 partially compensated by a carbon sink in tropical forest regrowth of 1.6 ± 0.5 Pg C year–1. Together, the fluxes comprise a net global forest sink of 1.1 ± 0.8 Pg C year–1, with tropical estimates having the largest uncertainties. Our total forest sink estimate is equivalent in magnitude to the terrestrial sink deduced from fossil fuel emissions and land-use change sources minus ocean and atmospheric sinks.},

  abstract = {This paper studies the performance and applicability of a novel kernel
	partial least squares (KPLS) algorithm for nonlinear feature extraction
	in the context of remote sensing applications. The so-called kernel
	orthonormalized PLS algorithm with reduced complexity (rKOPLS) has
	the following two core parts: 1) a kernel version of OPLS (called
	KOPLS) and 2) a sparse approximation for large-scale data sets, which
	ultimately leads to the rKOPLS algorithm. The method is theoretically
	analyzed in terms of computational burden and memory requirements
	and is tested in common remote sensing applications: multi- and hyper-spectral
	image classification and biophysical parameter estimation problems.
	The proposed method largely outperforms the traditional (linear)
	PLS algorithm and demonstrates good capabilities in terms of expressive
	power of the extracted nonlinear features, accuracy, and scalability
	as compared to the standard KPLS. © 2008 IEEE.},

  abstract = {The point of maximum slope on the reflectance spectrum of a plant
	leaf between red and near-infrared wavelengths is known as the red
	edge position (REP). The REP is strongly correlated with foliar chlorophyll
	content, and hence it provides a very sensitive indicator for a variety
	of environmental factors affecting leaves such as stress, drought
	and senescence. The REP is also present in spectra for vegetation
	recorded by remote sensing methods. Due to its importance for the
	application of inversion procedures, a number of techniques have
	been developed for determining the REP for foliar spectral reflectance.
	In this paper a new approach is proposed. It allows an unsupervised
	estimation of the REP. The accuracy of the new approach is evaluated
	by comparing REP estimates with values derived from measured spectral
	data for woody and herbaceous species available in the LOPEX (Leaf
	Optical Properties Experiment) database. © 2005 Taylor \& Francis

	optical properties. Moreover, λi could be a pertinent indicator

	are required for the monitoring, understanding and modeling of land
	surfaces at the global scale. While several products were already
	developed from the current medium resolution sensors, the few validation
	exercises currently achieved highlighted significant discrepancies
	and inconsistencies. The objective of this study is to develop improved
	global estimates of LAI, {FAPAR} and {FCOVER} variables by capitalizing
	on the development and validation of already existing products. In
	a first step, the performances of the MODIS, CYCLOPES, {GLOBCARBON}
	and JRC-FAPAR products were reviewed. The {MODIS} and {CYCLOPES}
	products were then selected since they provide higher level of consistency.
	These products were fused to generate the improved LAI, {FAPAR}
	and {FCOVER} values that were later scaled to closely match their
	expected range of variation. Finally, neural networks were trained
	to estimate these fused and scaled products from SPOT-VEGETATION
	top of canopy directionally normalized reflectance values. The resulting
	{GEOV1} products are associated to quality control flags as well
	as quantitative estimates of uncertainties. Performances of the {GEOV1}
	products are finally evaluated in a companion paper. The {GEOV1}
	products are freely available to the community at www.geoland2.eu

  abstract = {Hyperspectral reflectance data representing a wide range of canopies
	were simulated using the combined PROSPECT+SAIL model. The simulations
	were used to study the stability of recently proposed vegetation
	indices (VIs) derived from adjacent narrowband spectral reflectance
	data across the visible (VIS) and near infrared (NIR) region of the
	electromagnetic spectrum. The prediction power of these indices with
	respect to green leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll density
	(CCD) was compared, and their sensitivity to canopy architecture,
	illumination geometry, soil background reflectance, and atmospheric
	conditions were analyzed. The second soil-adjusted vegetation index
	(SAVI2) proved to be the best overall choice as a greenness measure.
	However, it is also shown that the dynamics of the VIs are very different
	in terms of their sensitivity to the different external factors that
	affects the spectral reflectance signatures of the various modeled
	canopies. It is concluded that hyperspectral indices are not necessarily
	better at predicting LAI and CCD, but that selection of a VI should
	depend upon (1) which parameter that needs to be estimated (LAI or
	CCD), (2) the expected range of this parameter, and (3) a priori
	knowledge of the variation of external parameters affecting the spectral
	reflectance of the canopy. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.},

  abstract = {This paper describes the scientific validation of the first version
	of global biophysical products (i.e., leaf area index, fraction of
	absorbed photosynthetically active radiation and fraction of vegetation
	cover), namely GEOV1, developed in the framework of the geoland-2/BioPar
	core mapping service at 1. km spatial resolution and 10-days temporal
	frequency. The strategy follows the recommendations of the CEOS/WGCV
	Land Product Validation for LAI global products validation. Several
	criteria of performance were evaluated, including continuity, spatial
	and temporal consistency, dynamic range of retrievals, statistical
	analysis per biome type, precision and accuracy. The spatial and
	temporal consistencies of GEOV1 products were assessed by intercomparison
	with reference global products (MODIS c5, CYCLOPES v3.1, GLOBCARBON
	v2 LAI, and JRC SeaWIFS FAPAR) over a global network of homogeneous
	sites (BELMANIP-2) during the 2003-2005 period. The accuracy of GEOV1
	was evaluated against a number of available ground reference maps.
	Our results show that GEOV1 products present reliable spatial distribution,
	smooth temporal profiles which are stable from year to year, good
	dynamic range with reliable magnitude for bare areas and dense forests,
	and optimal performances with ground-based maps. GEOV1 outperforms
	the quality of reference global products in most of the examined
	criteria, and constitutes a step forward in the development of consistent
	and accurate global biophysical variables within the context of the
	land monitoring core service of GMES. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {The main objective was to determine whether partial least squares
	(PLS) regression improves grass/herb biomass estimation when compared
	with hyperspectral indices, that is normalised difference vegetation
	index (NDVI) and red-edge position (REP). To achieve this objective,
	fresh green grass/herb biomass and airborne images (HyMap) were collected
	in the Majella National Park, Italy in the summer of 2005. The predictive
	performances of hyperspectral indices and PLS regression models were
	then determined and compared using calibration (n = 30) and test
	(n = 12) data sets. The regression model derived from NDVI computed
	from bands at 740 and 771 nm produced a lower standard error of prediction
	(SEP = 264 g m-2) on the test data compared with the standard NDVI
	involving bands at 665 and 801 nm (SEP = 331 g m-2), but comparable
	results with REPs determined by various methods (SEP = 261 to 295
	g m-2). PLS regression models based on original, derivative and continuum-removed
	spectra produced lower prediction errors (SEP = 149 to 256 g m-2)
	compared with NDVI and REP models. The lowest prediction error (SEP
	= 149 g m-2, 19% of mean) was obtained with PLS regression involving
	continuum-removed bands. In conclusion, PLS regression based on airborne
	hyperspectral imagery provides a better alternative to univariate
	regression involving hyperspectral indices for grass/herb biomass
	estimation in the Majella National Park. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All

	of Absorbed Photosynthetically Active Radiation (FAPAR) products
	derived from {MODIS} surface reflectance (MOD09CMG) at coarse resolution
	(0.05°) over crops. These Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) are
	estimated by using the inversion of the {PROSAIL} radiative transfer
	(BV-NNET tool) applied on {MODIS} {BRDF} (Bidirectional Reflectance
	Distribution Function) corrected surface reflectances and non-corrected.
	{ECV} estimates and the corresponding {MCD15A3} Collection 5
	and GEOLAND-2 (GEOv1) products are compared with {ECV} reference
	maps derived from BV-NNET applied on 105 high spatial resolution
	images (Formosat-2, 8&#xa0;m) which were acquired from 2006 to 2010
	in Southwest France. These latter are compared with local scale in
	situ measurements. The validation shows an uncertainty of 0.35 and
	0.07 for {LAI} and FAPAR, respectively. The comparison shows that
	the {ECV} estimates from the three products properly capture the
	crops phenology in agreement with reference maps. Results indicate
	that {MCD15A3} uncertainties (0.23 and 0.07 for {LAI} and FAPAR,
	respectively) are similar to previous intercomparison studies. {GEOv1}
	shows a systemic positive bias for both {LAI} and FAPAR. The best
	agreement with the reference maps is found for {MODIS} BV-NNET
	products with r2 higher than 0.9 and relative uncertainties lower
	than 17%. The use of BRDF-corrected surface reflectances as input
	of BV-NNET tool improves the uncertainty of {LAI} estimates (0.11,
	compared to 0.17 when directional surface reflectances are used as
	input) but not the uncertainty of {FAPAR} estimates. The deviation
	between {FAPAR} products which mostly affects low winter FAPAR,
	is related to the discrepancy of the soil directional assumption
	in {PROSAIL} model and {BRDF} correction method. The temporal
	stability of the daily {MODIS} BV-NNET products is better than
	the 4-day composite {MCD15A3} products. Finally, BV-NNET tool applied
	at finer resolutions demonstrates that the increase of the resolution
	results in a decrease of the {LAI} and {FAPAR} uncertainties
	and a conservation of the biases.},

	properties of crop canopies from remotely sensed data. Spectral reflectance
	and biophysical data were obtained over 132 plots of sugar beet (Beta
	vulgaris L.) and in the first part of the paper the strength of the
	relationships between vegetation indices (VI) and leaf area index
	(LAI) are examined. In the second part, an approach is tested in
	which a canopy reflectance model is used to generate simulated spectra
	for a wide range of biophysical conditions and these data are used
	to train an artificial neural network (ANN). The advantage of the
	second approach is that a priori knowledge of the measurement conditions
	including soil reflectance, canopy architecture and solar position
	can be included explicitly in the modelling. The results show that
	the estimation of sugar beet LAI using a trained neural network is
	more reliable than the use of VI and has the potential to replace
	the use of VI for operational applications. The use of a priori data
	on the variation in soil spectral reflectance gave rise to a small

  abstract = {Statistical and physical models have seldom been compared in studying
	grasslands. In this paper, both modeling approaches are investigated
	for mapping leaf area index (LAI) in a Mediterranean grassland (Majella
	National Park, Italy) using HyMap airborne hyperspectral images.
	We compared inversion of the PROSAIL radiative transfer model with
	narrow band vegetation indices (NDVI-like and SAVI2-like) and partial
	least squares regression (PLS). To assess the performance of the
	investigated models, the normalized RMSE (nRMSE) and R2 between in
	situ measurements of leaf area index and estimated parameter values
	are reported. The results of the study demonstrate that LAI can be
	estimated through PROSAIL inversion with accuracies comparable to
	those of statistical approaches (R2=0.89, nRMSE=0.22). The accuracy
	of the radiative transfer model inversion was further increased by
	using only a spectral subset of the data (R2=0.91, nRMSE=0.18). For
	the feature selection wavebands not well simulated by PROSAIL were
	sequentially discarded until all bands fulfilled the imposed accuracy
	requirements. © 2011 International Society for Photogrammetry and

  abstract = {Technological advances have opened the possibility to have Earth observation
	imagery combining both high spatial resolution with high revisit
	frequency. The monitoring of land surface processes will greatly
	benefit from this type of data if biophysical variables such as Leaf
	Area Index (LAI) can be retrieved from it. However, the large amounts
	of data that will become available call for methods satisfying constraint
	of (i) portability across different landscapes, (ii) independence
	from field measurements and (iii) computational efficiency. Currently,
	the most suitable technique to approach this objective is neural
	network inversion of radiative transfer. This paper quantifies the
	performance of such approach for a specific crop (winter wheat) all
	along the growing season. By re-defining the retrieved biophysical
	variable as Green Area Index (GAI) and correcting the typical saturation
	effect that affects the estimation of higher values, this study shows
	that physically-based retrieval can yield similar results to those
	obtained by empirical methods such as stepwise linear regression

  abstract = {Leaf area index (LAI) is a critical variable for land surface and
	climate modeling studies. Several global LAI products exist, and
	it is important to know how these products perform and what their
	uncertainties are. Five major global LAI products - MODIS, GEOV1,
	GLASS, GLOBMAP, and JRC-TIP - were compared between 2003 and 2010
	at a 0.01° spatial resolution and with a monthly time step. The
	daily Land-SAF product was used as a regional reference in order
	to evaluate the performance of other global products in Africa. Cross-sensor
	LAI conversion equations were derived for different biome types.
	Product uncertainties were assessed by looking into the product quantitative
	quality indicators (QQIs) attached to MODIS, GEOV1, and JRC-TIP.
	MODIS, GEOV1, GLASS, and GLOBMAP are generally consistent and show
	strong linear relationships between the products (R2 &gt; 0.74),
	with typical deviations of &lt; 0.5 for nonforest and &lt; 1.0 for
	forest biomes. JRC-TIP, the only effective LAI product, is about
	half the values of the other LAI products. The average uncertainties
	and relative uncertainties are in the following order: MODIS (0.17,
	11.5%) &lt; GEOV1 (0.24, 26.6%) &lt; Land-SAF (0.36, 37.8%) &lt;
	JRC-TIP (0.43, 114.3%). The highest relative uncertainties usually
	appear in ecological transition zones. More than 75% of MODIS, GEOV1,
	JRC-TIP, and Land-SAF pixels are within the absolute uncertainty
	requirements (± 0.5) set by the Global Climate Observing System
	(GCOS), whereas more than 78.5% of MODIS and 44.6% of GEOV1 pixels
	are within the threshold for relative uncertainty (20%). This study
	reveals the discrepancies mainly due to differences between definitions,
	retrieval algorithms, and input data. Future product development
	and validation studies should focus on areas (e.g., sparsely vegetated
	and savanna areas) and periods (e.g., winter time) with higher uncertainties.

  abstract = {The objective of this paper is to quantitatively validate the global
	MODIS and CYCLOPES leaf area index (LAI) products using a global
	LAI field measurement database created on the basis of a literature
	review and major validation campaigns. The MODIS LAI product suite,
	containing the Terra Collection 4 (C4), Terra Collection 5 (C5) and
	Terra. +. Aqua combined C5, was analyzed, with considerable attention
	paid to the quality control (QC) information. The CYCLOPES V3.1 LAI
	product was similarly analyzed with regard to the status map (SM)
	layer. In general, the MODIS LAI has improved consistently over all
	releases. MODIS C5 data retrieved with the main algorithm (QC < 64)
	and CYCLOPES data showed a similar range of uncertainties (1.0-1.2).
	Uncertainties for the best MODIS C5 (QC = 0) and CYCLOPES (SM = 0)
	estimates were around 0.9-1.1. The overall mean differences between
	the best MODIS C5 and CYCLOPES were within ± 0.10. The highest correspondence
	was obtained for woody biomes from the best MCD15 C5 data (RMSE =
	0.80). Results indicate that the uncertainties in current LAI products
	(around ± 1.0) are still unable to meet the accuracy requirement
	of GCOS (± 0.5). Although there are limitations, we recommend MODIS
	C5 retrieved with the main algorithm (QC < 64) and CYCLOPES for the
	user community. This study demonstrates the necessity of exploring
	uncertainties related to the true and effective LAIs separately,
	and reveals the importance of referring to the quality assessment
	information. More field measurements are required for further studies,
	which should focus on under-sampled biome types and areas. © 2011

  abstract = {Protein, lignin, cellulose, hemicellulose, sugar, and starch contents
	per unit leaf area of fresh leaves were related to the corresponding
	reflectance and transmittance spectra using multiple linear regressions.
	When the regressions are evaluated over the data set used for calibrating,
	they show relatively good performances. However, applying these relations
	to an independent data set led to very poor performances. It was
	concluded that the detailed canopy biochemistry was not accessible
	in a robust way from fresh leaf optical properties measurements over
	a large range of leaf types. The only variables that can be accurately
	derived from leaf reflectance or transmittance measurements are water
	and dry matter (i.e., the specific leaf weight) contents per unit
	leaf area. Transforming reflectance (\CF?) or transmittance (τ) values
	into the corresponding absorbance (log(1/τ) or log(1/τ)) values
	improves the accuracy of the estimates. Using transmittance rather
	than reflectance provides better retrieval performances. We investigated
	the sensitivity of the relationships to the radiometric noise associated
	to reflectance or transmittance measurements. It appears, particularly
	for water, that the estimates are quite sensitive to the radiometric
	resolution of the instrument used. We propose a technique that minimizes
	the sensitivity of the estimates to the radiometric noise and improves
	their robustness. It consists of enlarging the calibration data set
	by adding random instrumental noise similar to that observed over
	the test data set. Results show that, this way, three wavebands (1910,
	1380, and 900 nm for water; 2310, 2160, and 1870nm for dry matter)
	allow good estimates of water (RMSE = 0.0011 g cm-2) and dry matter

  abstract = {Most bacterial and fungal plant pathogens require free moisture for
	infection and reproduction so a disease forecasting model needs to
	estimate wetness duration on plant surfaces if direct measurement
	is unavailable. Artificial neural network (ANN) models with a backpropagation
	architecture were developed to predict wetness on wheat flag leaves
	using environmental variables recorded at 0.5 h intervals by an electronic
	datalogger. For comparison, multivariate discriminant and stepwise
	logistic models also predicted wetness, and dew periods were predicted
	with a classification tree-discrimination approach, a relative humidity
	indicator, and a physical model. ANN and logistic models correctly
	classified 93% and 90% of the validation cases and were more accurate
	than discriminant models. Many of the ANN errors occurred during
	times of dew onset or evaporation and were ≤ 1 h per event. Model
	accuracy for all methods improved 3-4% when input data from a wetness
	sensor positioned above vegetation were included. The average absolute
	error per night for prediction of dew period was 0.6 h for the classification-discrimination
	model, 0.8-1.1 h for ANN models, 1.2 h for a logistic model, 1.4
	h for the physical model, and 2.1 h for the relative humidity index.
	ANN and logistic models thus performed well compared to previously
	developed models for prediction of dew duration and these models
	predicted leaf wetness from both dew and rain, an advantage for disease
	forecasting. Further improvements in ANN performance are possible,
	making the technique a viable research tool.},

  abstract = {The inversion of physically based reflectance models is increasingly
	efficient for extracting vegetation variables from remote sensing
	images. It requires a vegetation reflectance model and an inversion
	method that are accurate and efficient. Usually, the complexity of
	reflectance models implies to use specific inversion methods (e.g.,
	look-up table and neural network). Unfortunately, these methods are
	valid only for the view-sun directions for which they are designed.
	A developed look-up table based inversion method avoids this limitation:
	it generalizes any look-up table for any view-sun direction, and
	more generally for any input parameter value. It uses a look-up table
	made of ci coefficients of any analytical expression h that fits
	a set of reflectance values simulated by the Discrete Anisotropic
	Radiative Transfer (DART) model. Interpolation on coefficients ci
	allows h to give reflectance values for any input parameter value.
	We settled some options of the inversion method with sensitivity
	studies: tree covers are simulated with 4-tree scenes, expression
	h has six coefficients ci and the interpolation is the continuous
	first derivative interpolation method. Moreover, the robustness of
	the inversion method was validated. The ability to generalize a look-up
	table for any view-sun direction was successfully tested with the
	inversion of SPOT images of Fontainebleau (France) forest. LAI maps
	proved to be as accurate (i.e., RMSE ≈ 1.3) as those obtained with
	classical relationships that are calibrated with in situ LAI measurements.
	Here, the advantage of our inversion method was to avoid this calibration.

  abstract = {In recent years, hyperspectral and multi-angular approaches for quantifying
	biophysical characteristics of vegetation have become more widely
	used. In fact, as both hyperspectral and multi-angle reflectance
	decrease the level of noise on retrieved geophysical parameter values,
	they increase their reliability by also reducing the saturation problem
	of the relationships between vegetation indices and biophysical characteristics.
	To test which is the best methodology in estimating some important
	biophysical grassland parameters (biomass, total and percent biomass
	nitrogen content, phytomass and its total and percent nitrogen content),
	nadir and off-nadir measurements were carried out, three times during
	the vegetative period of 2004, in a permanent flat meadow located
	in the experimental farm of the University of Padua, Italy. The two
	approaches and the broad band vegetation indices calculated using
	Landsat bands were compared considering both the best determination
	coefficients of five vegetation indices, calculated with the two
	analysis, and through a partial least squares regression using different
	spectral regions measured at different angles as predictive variables.
	Using nadir data the red edge region was the most useful for the
	prediction of biophysical variables, especially phytomass, but also
	nitrogen content. The off-nadir data did not provide any significance
	differences in results to that of data obtained in nadir view but
	both methods seem to be better adapted to describe biophysical parameters
	of vegetation than the use of broad band vegetation indices.},

  abstract = {Leaf chlorophyll content provides valuable information about physiological
	status of plants. Reflectance measurement makes it possible to quickly
	and non-destructively assess, in situ, the chlorophyll content in
	leaves. Our objective was to investigate the spectral behavior of
	the relationship between reflectance and chlorophyll content and
	to develop a technique for non-destructive chlorophyll estimation
	in leaves with a wide range of pigment content and composition using
	reflectance in a few broad spectral bands. Spectral reflectance of
	maple, chestnut, wild vine and beech leaves in a wide range of pigment
	content and composition was investigated. It was shown that reciprocal
	reflectance (Rλ)-1 in the spectral range λ from 520 to 550 nm and
	695 to 705 nm related closely to the total chlorophyll content in
	leaves of all species. Subtraction of near infra-red reciprocal reflectance,
	(RNIR)-1, from (Rλ)-1 made index [(Rλ)-1-(RNIR)-1] linearly proportional
	to the total chlorophyll content in spectral ranges λ from 525 to
	555 nm and from 695 to 725 nm with coefficient of determination r2
	&gt; 0.94. To adjust for differences in leaf structure, the product
	of the latter index and NIR reflectance [(Rλ)-1-(RNIR)-1]* (RNIR)
	was used; this further increased the accuracy of the chlorophyll
	estimation in the range λ from 520 to 585 nm and from 695 to 740
	nm. Two independent data sets were used to validate the developed
	algorithms. The root mean square error of the chlorophyll prediction
	did not exceed 50 μmol/m2 in leaves with total chlorophyll ranged
	from 1 to 830 μmol/m2.},

	quantify leaf carbon, nitrogen, lignin, cellulose, dry weight, and
	water compositions from leaf level reflectance (R). Two fresh leaf
	and one dry leaf datasets containing a broad range of native and
	cultivated plant species were examined using unconstrainied stepwise
	multiple linear regression and constrained regression with wavelengths
	reported from other leaf level studies and wavelengths derived from
	chemical spectroscopy. Although stepwise multiple linear regression
	explained large amounts of the variation in the chemical data, the
	bands selected were not related to known absorption bauds, varied
	among datasets and expression bases for the chemical [concentration
	(g g-1) or content (g m-2)], did not correspond to bands selected
	in other studies, and were sensitive to the samples entered into
	the regression. Stepwise multiple regression using artificially constucted
	datasets that randomized the association between nitrogen concentration
	and reflectance spectra produced coefficients of determination (R2's)
	between 0.41 and 0.82 for first and second derivative lag(1/R) spectra.
	The R2's for correctly-paired nitrogen data and first and second
	derivative log(1/R) only exceeded the average randomized R2's by
	0.02- 0.42. Replication of this randomization experiment otl a larger
	dry ground leaf data set from the Harvard Forest showed the same
	trends but lower R2's. All of these results suggest caution in the
	use of stepwise mutliple linear regression on fresh leaf reflectance
	spectra. Band selection does not appear to be based upon the absorption
	characteristic of the chemecal being examined.},

	(MODIS) land cover products are 500-m sub-pixel representations of
	basic vegetation characteristics including tree, herbaceous and bare
	ground cover. Our previous approach to deriving continuous fields
	used a linear mixture model based on spectral endmembers of forest,
	grassland and bare ground training. We present here a new approach
	for estimating percent tree cover employing continuous training data
	over the whole range of tree cover. The continuous training data
	set is derived by aggregating high-resolution tree cover to coarse
	scales and is used with multi-temporal metrics based on a full year
	of coarse resolution satellite data. A regression tree algorithm
	is used to predict the dependent variable of tree cover based on
	signatures from the multi-temporal metrics. The automated algorithm
	was tested globally using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer
	(AVHRR) data, as a full year of MODIS data has not yet been collected.
	A root mean square error (rmse) of 9.06% tree cover was found from
	the global training data set. Preliminary MODIS products are also
	presented, including a 250-m map of the lower 48 United States and
	500-m maps of tree cover and leaf type for North America. Results
	show that the new approach used with MODIS data offers an improved
	characterization of land cover. © 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All

	was to use early repeated remotely sensed multi-spectral data to
	predict grain yield and quality for winter wheat (Triticum aestivum
	L.) and spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). The crops were sown with
	two different seeding rates and a wide range of nitrogen strategies
	were applied. Multi-way partial least squares regression (N-PLS)
	was used to predict grain yield and protein content. The results
	were compared with unfold-PLS1 and PLS1 using reflectance data from
	the last measurement day. Both single reflectance wavelengths and
	selected vegetation indices were used simultaneously. The results
	reveal that all models can make a good prediction of yield in both
	crops with unfold-PLS1 and N-PLS as the best. However, estimation
	of grain protein content at harvest was very poorly determined in
	barley, as no relation between the reflectance measurements and barley
	protein content was obtained. The relation between reflectance measurements
	and protein content was slightly better in wheat, where especially
	N-PLS improved the prediction of grain protein content. The overall
	conclusion of the present experiments is that data from repeated
	measurements of reflectance used in multi-way partial least squares
	regression before heading improved the prediction of grain yield

  abstract = {For crop management, information on the actual status of the crop
	is important for taking decisions on nitrogen supply, water supply
	or harvesting. One would also like to take into account the local
	spatial variation of the crop. Remote sensing has proved to be a
	useful technique for estimating and mapping the spatial variation
	of various biophysical variables. Calibration of the image data is
	crucial in the performance and applicability of this technique. The
	aim of this paper is to show the possibility to calibrate remotely
	sensed imagery using fast and non-destructive close-range (below
	1.3 m height) sensing instruments, thus providing a means for the
	assessment of plant characteristics over large areas at low costs.
	This concept was tested on a homogeneously managed grassland field,
	subdivided into 20 plots of 15 × 3 m, at the end of July 2004. Reflected
	radiation was recorded with an active close-range sensing device,
	consisting of a visible light and near-infrared (NIR) imaging spectrograph,
	and a 3CCD camera, equipped with special band filters (central wavelengths
	are at 600, 710 and 800 nm). An airborne campaign with a four-band
	UltraCam digital CCD camera was used for extrapolation to larger
	scales. Plots were harvested, and fresh and dry biomass and leaf
	nitrogen content were determined. Partial least squares (PLS) models
	combining spectral and spatial information from the close-sensing
	device yielded acceptable results in predicting grassland yields
	and nitrogen content. Subsequently, these predictions were used to
	calibrate a model with the image data of the remote sensing device.
	These were then compared, using leave-one-out cross-validation, with
	the measured field variables, and the model proved to have an acceptable
	predictive power.},

  abstract = {The concentrations of various foliar chemicals can be estimated by
	analyzing the spectral reflectance of dried ground leaves. The continuum-removal
	analysis of Kokaly and Clark [Remote Sens. Environ. 67 (1999) 267]
	has been an improvement on the standard derivative analysis in such
	applications. Continuum-removal analysis enables the isolation of
	absorption features of interest, thus increasing the coefficients
	of determination and facilitating the identification of more sensible
	absorption features. The purpose of this study was to test Kokaly
	and Clark's methodology with aircraft-acquired hyperspectral data
	of eucalypt tree canopies, which are more complex than are spectra
	from many coniferous canopies and much more complex than the spectra
	from dried ground leaves. The results of the continuum-removal analysis
	were most encouraging. It identified, in one experiment or another,
	almost all of the known nitrogen absorption features. The coefficient
	of determination in one case increased from 0.65, using the standard
	derivative analysis, to 0.85 with the continuum-removal analysis.
	It is recommended that continuum-removal analysis become at least
	a supplement to standard derivative analysis in estimating foliar
	biochemical concentrations from remote sensing data. This study also
	reports several other findings: (1) the neural network method generally
	achieved higher coefficients of determination and lower errors of
	estimation [root mean square error (RMSE) and standard error of cross
	validation (SECV)] than did the modified partial least squares (PLS)
	or stepwise regression methods, probably indicating nonlinear relationships
	between biochemical concentrations and canopy reflectance; (2) modified
	partial least squares (MPLS) proved a better statistical method than
	conventional stepwise regression analysis in many cases in terms
	of both coefficient of determination and RMSE; and (3) the maximum
	spectrum of a cluster of tree pixels represents canopy reflectance
	at least as well as the mean spectrum of the cluster, especially
	when used in conjunction with the modified partial least squares
	method. © 2004 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	trees), and (2) map the vegetation cover using machine learning decision
	trees based on either the scaled reflectance data or mixture tuned

	HyMap airborne data (126 bands at 2.3 × 2.3 m spatial resolution),
	collected over the U.S. Department of Energy uranium processing sites
	near Monticello, Utah and Monument Valley, Arizona, were used. Grass
	and shrub species were mixed on an engineered disposal cell cover
	at the Monticello site while shrub species were dominant in the phytoremediation
	plantings at the Monument Valley site. Regression trees resulted
	in the best calibration performance of LAI estimation (R 2 &gt; 0.80.
	The use of REPs failed to accurately predict LAI (R 2 &lt; 0.2).
	The use of the MTMF-derived metrics (matched filter scores and infeasibility)
	and a range of vegetation indices in decision trees improved the
	vegetation mapping when compared to the decision tree classification
	using just the scaled reflectance. Results suggest that hyperspectral
	imagery are useful for characterizing biophysical characteristics
	(LAI) and vegetation cover on capped hazardous waste sites. However,
	it is believed that the vegetation mapping would benefit from the
	use of higher spatial resolution hyperspectral data due to the small

  volume = {5},

  abstract = {Chlorophyll contents in vegetation depend on soil nitrogen availability
	and on crop nitrogen uptake, which are important management factors
	in arable farming. Crop nitrogen uptake is important, as nitrogen
	is needed for chlorophyll formation, which is important for photosynthesis,
	i.e. the conversion of absorbed radiance into plant biomass. The
	objective of this study was to estimate leaf and canopy nitrogen
	contents by near and remote sensing observations and to link observations
	at leaf, plant and canopy level. A theoretical base is presented
	for scaling-up leaf optical properties to whole plants and crops,
	by linking different optical recording techniques at leaf, plant
	and canopy levels through the integration of vertical nitrogen distribution.
	Field data come from potato experiments in The Netherlands in 1997
	and 1998, comprising two potato varieties: Eersteling and Bintje,
	receiving similar nitrogen treatments (0, 100, 200 and 300 kg N ha-1)
	in varying application schemes to create differences in canopy nitrogen
	status during the growing season. Ten standard destructive field
	samplings were performed to follow leaf area index and crop dry weight
	evolution. Samples were analysed for inorganic nitrogen and total
	nitrogen contents. At sampling dates, spectral measurements were
	taken both at leaf level and at canopy level. At leaf level, an exponential
	relation between SPAD-502 readings and leaf organic nitrogen contents
	with a high correlation factor of 0.91 was found. At canopy level,
	an exponential relation between canopy organic nitrogen contents
	and red edge position (λ rep, nm) derived from reflectance measurements
	was found with a good correlation of 0.82. Spectral measurements
	(SPAD-502) at leaf level of a few square mm were related to canopy
	reflectance measurements (CropScan™) of approximately 0.44 m2.
	Statistical regression techniques were used to optimise theoretical
	vertical nitrogen profiles that allowed scaling-up leaf chlorophyll
	measurements to canopy nitrogen values. A nitrogen attenuation coefficient
	(kN) of 0.41 g N m-2 soil resulted in highest correlation coefficients
	for scaling-up nitrogen contents from leaf to canopy values. Remote
	sensing of canopy nitrogen (g N m-2 soil) did not require considering
	vertical nitrogen profiles, as canopy reflectance measurements were
	able to integrate organic nitrogen over total canopy depth. The integration
	of near sensing techniques, theories on the interpretation of reflectance
	signatures and vertical crop nitrogen distribution allowed scaling
	between leaf chlorophyll measurements and canopy nitrogen values.
	This results in more accurate quantification of the nitrogen status
	of a potato crop, which is important information in potato crop management.

  abstract = {Accurate mapping of secondary forest and the age of these forests
	is critical to assess the carbon budget in tropical regions accurately.
	Using SPOT HRV (High Resolution Visible) data, techniques were developed
	and tested to discriminate primary forest, secondary forest and deforested
	areas on a study site in Rondonia, Brazil. Six co-registered SPOT
	HRV images (1986, 1988, 1989, 1991, 1992 and 1994) were used to create
	a time series of classified images of land cover (primary forest,
	secondary forest and deforested). These trajectories were used to
	identify secondary forest age classes relative to the most recent
	(1994) image. The resultant 1994 map of primary forest, secondary
	forest age classes and deforested areas served as ground reference
	data to establish training and testing sites. Several band 2 and
	3 texture measurements were calculated using a 3 x 3 window to quantify
	canopy homogeneity. Neural networks and linear analysis techniques
	were tested for discriminating between primary forest, secondary
	forest and deforested pixels. The techniques were also employed to
	extract secondary forest age. A neural network using band 3 and a
	texture measure of band 2 and 3 from a single image (1994) discriminated
	primary forest, secondary forest (1 to &gt;9 years) and deforested
	pixel with an average accuracy of 95%. The use of texture information
	increased the secondary forest discrimination accuracy 6.4% (from
	83.5 to 89.9%). Spectral and textural information were also used
	to predict secondary forest age as a continous variable. The neural
	network with the highest accuracy produced a RMSE (predicted network
	age versus actual secondary forest age) of 2.0 years with a coefficient
	of determination (predicted versus true) of 0.38. These results were
	significantly improved by using multitemporal information. The spectral
	and textural information from two images (1994 and 1989) were used
	to extract secondary forest information. The neural network results
	showed that 95.5% of the secondary forest pixels were correctly classified
	as secondary forest pixels (as opposed to 89.9% of the pixels using
	only the 1994 image). The RMSE and R2 accuracies in extracting secondary
	forest age as a continuous variable were 1.3 and 0.75, respectively.
	Using SPOT High Resolution Visible (HRV) data, techniques were developed
	and tested to discriminate primary forest, secondary forest and deforested
	areas on a study site in Rondonia, Brazil. Several band 2 and 3 texture
	measurements were calculated using a 3×3 window to quantify canopy
	homogeneity. Neural networks and linear analysis techniques were
	tested for discriminating between primary forest, secondary forest
	and deforested pixels. The techniques were also used to extract secondary
	forest age. The results demonstrate that primary forest, secondary
	forest and deforested pixels can be accurately classified using band
	3 and a texture measurement of band 2 and 3 from a single image using
	neural networks. The use of texture information increased the secondary
	forest discrimination accuracy.},

  abstract = {A strong positive correlation between vegetation canopy bidirectional
	reflectance factor (BRF) in the near infrared (NIR) spectral region
	and foliar mass-based nitrogen concentration (%N) has been reported
	in some temperate and boreal forests. This relationship, if true,
	would indicate an additional role for nitrogen in the climate system
	via its influence on surface albedo and may offer a simple approach
	for monitoring foliar nitrogen using satellite data. We report, however,
	that the previously reported correlation is an artifact-it is a consequence
	of variations in canopy structure, rather than of %N. The data underlying
	this relationship were collected at sites with varying proportions
	of foliar nitrogen-poor needleleaf and nitrogen-rich broadleaf species,
	whose canopy structure differs considerably. When the BRF data are
	corrected for canopy-structure effects, the residual reflectance
	variations are negatively related to %N at all wavelengths in the
	interval 423-855 nm. This suggests that the observed positive correlation
	between BRF and %N conveys no information about %N. We find that
	to infer leaf biochemical constituents, e.g., N content, from remotely
	sensed data, BRF spectra in the interval 710-790 nm provide critical
	information for correction of structural influences. Our analysis
	also suggests that surface characteristics of leaves impact remote
	sensing of its internal constituents. This further decreases the
	ability to remotely sense canopy foliar nitrogen. Finally, the analysis
	presented here is generic to the problem of remote sensing of leaf-tissue
	constituents and is therefore not a specific critique of articles
	espousing remote sensing of foliar %N.},

  title = {Towards universal broad leaf chlorophyll indices using {PROSPECT}

  journal = {Rem. Sens. Env.},
  year = {2004},
  volume = {89},
  pages = {1-28},
  number = {1},
  abstract = {Fifty-three leaves were randomly sampled on different deciduous tree
	species, representing a wide range of chlorophyll contents, tree
	ages, and leaf structural features. Their reflectance was measured
	between 400 and 800 nm with a 1-nm step, and their chlorophyll content
	determined by extraction. A larger simulated database (11,583 spectra)
	was built using the PROSPECT model, in order to test, calibrate,
	and obtain universal indices, i.e., indices applicable to a wide
	range of species and leaf structure. To our knowledge, almost all
	leaf chlorophyll indices published in the literature since 1973 have
	been tested on both databases. Fourteen canonical types of indices
	(published ones and new ones) were identified, and their wavelengths
	calibrated on the simulated database as well as on the experimental
	database to determine the best wavelengths and, hence, the best performances
	in chlorophyll estimation for each index types. These indices go
	from simple reflectance ratios to more sophisticated indices using
	reflectance first derivatives (using the Savitzky and Golay method).
	We also tested other nondestructive methods to obtain total chlorophyll
	concentration: SPAD (Minolta Camera, Osaka, Japan) and neural networks.
	The validity of the actual PROSPECT model is challenged by our results:
	Important discordances are found when the indices are calculated
	with PROSPECT compared to experimental data, especially for some
	indices and wavelengths. The discordance is even greater when the
	indices are determined with PROSPECT and applied on the experimental
	database. A new calibration of PROSPECT is therefore necessary for
	any study aiming at using simulated spectra to determine or to calibrate
	indices. The "peak jump" and the multiple-peak feature observed on
	the first derivative of the reflectances (e.g., in the Red-Edge Inflection
	Point [REIP] index) has been investigated. It was shown that chlorophyll
	absorption alone can explain this feature. The peak jump disqualifies
	the REIP to be a valuable chlorophyll index. A simple modified difference
	ratio gave the best results among all published indices (cross-validated
	RMSE=2.1 μg/cm2 on the experimental database). After calibration
	on the experimental database, modified Simple Ratio (mSR) and modified
	Normalized Difference (mND) indices gave the best performances (RMSECV=1.8
	μg/cm2 on the experimental database). The new Double Difference
	(DD) index, although not the best on the experimental database (RMSECV=2.9
	μg/cm2), has the best results on the larger simulated database (RMSE=3.7
	μg/cm2) and is expected to give good results on larger experimental
	databases. The best reflectance-based indices give better performances
	than the current commercial nondestructive device SPAD (RMSECV=4.5
	μg/cm2). In this leaf-level study, the best indices are very near
	from each other, so that complex methods are useless: REIP-like,
	neural networks, and derivative-based indices are not necessary and
	give worst results than simpler properly chosen indices. These conclusions
	will certainly be different for a canopy-level study, where the derivative-based
	indices may perform significantly better than the other ones. ©

  abstract = {Snow/ice albedo is a critical variable in surface energy balance calculations.
	The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data have
	been used routinely to provide global land surface albedo. The MODIS
	algorithm includes atmospheric correction, surface reflectance angular
	modeling, and narrowband to broadband albedo conversion. In an earlier
	study, a "direct retrieval" methodology was proposed to calculate
	instantaneous albedo, over snow and ice-covered surfaces directly
	from top-of-atmosphere (TOA) MODIS reflectance data. The method consists
	of extensive radiative transfer simulations for a variety of atmospheric
	and surface snow conditions and links the TOA reflectance with surface
	broadband albedo through regression analysis. Therefore the direct
	retrieval algorithm implicitly incorporates in a single step all
	three procedures used in the standard MODIS surface albedo algorithm.
	This study presents improvements to the retrieval algorithm including
	validation with in situ measurements distributed over the Greenland
	ice sheet. Comparison with surface observations demonstrates that
	the direct retrieval algorithm can produce very accurate daily snow/ice
	albedo with mean bias of less than 0.02 and residual standard error
	of 0.04. Copyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.},

  abstract = {The UV-laser ( 1/2 355 nm) induced fluorescence emission spectra of
	green leaves comprise the blue (F440) and green (F520) fluorescence
	bands as well as the red (F690) and far-red (F740) chlorophyll fluorescence
	emission bands. Based on the four UV-laser induced fluorescence bands
	blue, green, red and far-red a high resolution fluorescence imaging
	system was established, which allows a fast and large scale screening
	of fluorescence gradients and local disturbances in fluorescence
	emission over the whole leaf surface. The new imaging method not
	only permits to screen leaves by means of images in four fluorescence
	bands (LIF images) but, in addition, via images of the fluorescence
	ratios blue/red (F440/F690), blue/far-red (F440/F740), the chlorophyll
	fluorescence ratio red/far-red (F690/F740) and the ratio blue/green
	(F440/F520) (LIF ratio images). By fluorescence imaging we could
	prove that in aurea tobacco the major part of the leaves' blue and
	green fluorescence is emitted from the main and side leave veins,
	whereas the major part of the leaves' red and far-red chlorophyll
	fluorescence is emitted from the vein-free leaf regions, which also
	have the highest chlorophyll content. A smaller proportion of the
	aurea tobacco leaves' blue- green fluorescence emission is derived
	from the cell walls of epidermis cells. The fluorescence ratios blue/red
	and blue/far-red are very sensitive to environmental changes, and
	thus permit early stress and strain detection in plants, and the
	evaluation of damage to the photosynthetic apparatus. Via monitoring
	the increase in chlorophyll fluorescence LIF images allow to detect
	differences in the time-dependent uptake of diuron and the progressing
	inhibition of photosynthetic electron transport in the treated leaf
	part. The novel fluorescence imaging technique sets a new dimension
	for early stress detection in the photosynthetic apparatus and in
	plants. It has many advantages over the previously applied point-data
	measurements of selected leaf points using conventional spectrofluorometers.
	The new fluorescence imaging system proved to be very suitable for
	remote sensing of plants in the near distance, and can be further
	developed for far distance remote sensing of the state of health
	of terrestrial vegetation. Some examples in the many possible ways
	of computer-aided fluorescence data processing (formation of different
	fluorescence ratios, screening of fluorescence profiles, histogramme
	plotting) are indicated.},

	area index (LAI, m2leaf msoil- 2) and leaf canopy biomass (Bleaf,
	gdry matter msoil- 2). These parameters are useful inputs for forest
	ecosystem simulations at landscape scale. The method is based on
	the determination of the best vegetation indices (index form and
	wavelengths) using the radiative transfer model PROSAIL (formed by
	the newly-calibrated leaf reflectance model PROSPECT coupled with
	the multi-layer version of the canopy radiative transfer model SAIL).
	The results are tested on experimental measurements at both leaf
	and canopy scales. At the leaf scale, it is possible to estimate
	CHL with high precision using a two wavelength vegetation index after
	a simulation based calibration. At the leaf scale, the LMA is more
	difficult to estimate with indices. At the canopy scale, efficient
	indices were determined on a generic simulated database to estimate
	CHL, LMA, LAI and Bleaf in a general way. These indices were then
	applied to two Hyperion images (50 plots) on the Fontainebleau and
	Fougères forests and portable spectroradiometer measurements. They
	showed good results with an RMSE of 8.2μg cm- 2 for CHL, 9.1g
	m- 2 for LMA, 1.7m2 m- 2 for LAI and 50.6g m- 2 for Bleaf. However,
	at the canopy scale, even if the wavelengths of the calibrated indices
	were accurately determined with the simulated database, the regressions
	between the indices and the biophysical characteristics still had
	to be calibrated on measurements. At the canopy scale, the best indices
	were: for leaf chlorophyll content: NDchl = (\CF?925 - \CF?710)/(\CF?925
	+ \CF?710), for leaf mass per area: NDLMA = (\CF?2260 - \CF?1490)/(\CF?2260
	+ \CF?1490), for leaf area index: DLAI = \CF?1725 - \CF?970, and for canopy
	leaf biomass: NDBleaf = (\CF?2160 - \CF?1540)/(\CF?2160 + \CF?1540). © 2008

  abstract = {The use of remote sensing is necessary for monitoring forest carbon
	stocks at large scales. Optical remote sensing, although not the
	most suitable technique for the direct estimation of stand biomass,
	offers the advantage of providing large temporal and spatial datasets.
	In particular, information on canopy structure is encompassed in
	stand reflectance time series. This study focused on the example
	of Eucalyptus forest plantations, which have recently attracted much
	attention as a result of their high expansion rate in many tropical
	countries. Stand scale time-series of Normalized Difference Vegetation
	Index (NDVI) were obtained from MODIS satellite data after a procedure
	involving un-mixing and interpolation, on about 15,000ha of plantations
	in southern Brazil. The comparison of the planting date of the current
	rotation (and therefore the age of the stands) estimated from these
	time series with real values provided by the company showed that
	the root mean square error was 35.5days. Age alone explained more
	than 82% of stand wood volume variability and 87% of stand dominant
	height variability. Age variables were combined with other variables
	derived from the NDVI time series and simple bioclimatic data by
	means of linear (Stepwise) or nonlinear (Random Forest) regressions.
	The nonlinear regressions gave r-square values of 0.90 for volume
	and 0.92 for dominant height, and an accuracy of about 25m3/ha for
	volume (15% of the volume average value) and about 1.6m for dominant
	height (8% of the height average value). The improvement including
	NDVI and bioclimatic data comes from the fact that the cumulative
	NDVI since planting date integrates the interannual variability of
	leaf area index (LAI), light interception by the foliage and growth
	due for example to variations of seasonal water stress. The accuracy
	of biomass and height predictions was strongly improved by using
	the NDVI integrated over the two first years after planting, which
	are critical for stand establishment. These results open perspectives
	for cost-effective monitoring of biomass at large scales in intensively-managed
	plantation forests. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

	of a Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stand, we propose a
	new Cab sensitive index located between 650 and 720nm and termed
	ANCB650-720. The performance of ANCB650-720 was validated against
	ground-measured Cab of ten spruce crowns and compared with Cab estimated
	by a conventional artificial neural network (ANN) trained with continuum
	removed RT simulations and also by three previously published chlorophyll
	optical indices: normalized difference between reflectance at 925
	and 710nm (ND925&amp;710), simple reflectance ratio between 750 and
	710nm (SR750/710) and the ratio of TCARI/OSAVI indices. Although
	all retrieval methods produced visually comparable Cab spatial patterns,
	the ground validation revealed that the ANCB650-720 and ANN retrievals
	are more accurate than the other three chlorophyll indices (R2=0.72
	for both methods). ANCB650-720 estimated Cab with an RMSE=2.27μgcm-2
	(relative RRMSE=4.35%) and ANN with an RMSE=2.18μgcm-2 (RRMSE=4.18%),
	while SR750/710 with an RMSE=4.16μgcm-2 (RRMSE=7.97%), ND925&amp;710
	with an RMSE=9.07μgcm-2 (RRMSE=17.38%) and TCARI/OSAVI with an RMSE=12.30μgcm-2
	(RRMSE=23.56%). Also the systematic RMSES was lower than the unsystematic
	one only for the ANCB650-720 and ANN retrievals. Our results indicate
	that the newly proposed index can provide the same accuracy as ANN
	except for Cab values below 30μgcm-2, which are slightly overestimated
	(RMSE=2.42μgcm-2). The computationally efficient ANCB650-720 retrieval
	provides accurate high spatial resolution airborne Cab maps, considerable
	as a suitable reference data for validating satellite-based Cab products.

  abstract = {Pasture qualilty, expressed as a percentage of total digestible nutrients
	(nitrogen, potassium, phosphorous, calcium and magnesium), is a major
	factor determining the grazing patterns of wildlife and livestock.
	Existing rangeland monitoring techniques seldom reflect the nutritive
	quality of the pastures and are consequently of limited value in
	explaining animal distribution. Techniques that can estimate pasture
	quality on a large scale are therefore critical in understanding
	and explaining wildlife and livestock distribution. We present the
	results of a greenhouse experiment designed to estimate the concentrations
	of nitrogen, potassium, phosphorous, calcium, magnesium and non-detergent
	fibre (NDF), using the reflectance of a tropical grass (Cenchrus
	ciliaris) canopy. Canopy spectral measurements were taken under controlled
	laboratory conditions using a GER 3700 spectroradiometer. We tested
	the utility of using the band depth analysis methodology in the visible
	region (where water absorption is less effective) to estimate foliar
	chemistry in fresh canopies. Continuum removal was applied to the
	visible absorption feature centred at 670 nm, and band depth ratios
	(BDRs) were calculated. Stepwise linear regression was used to select
	wavelengths from calculated BDRs that were highly correlated with
	foliar chemistry in a randomly selected training dataset. The resulting
	regression models were used to predict foliar chemistry in a test
	dataset. Results indicate that stepwise regression on bands calculated
	from continuum-removed reflectance spectra could predict foliar nutrient
	concentration with high accuracy. The correlations were highest for
	magnesium and nitrogen (R 2=0.77 and 0.73 respectively, using the

  abstract     = {The terrestrial biosphere is a key regulator of atmospheric chemistry and climate. During past periods of climate change, vegetation cover and interactions between the terrestrial biosphere and atmosphere changed within decades. Modern observations show a similar responsiveness of terrestrial biogeochemistry to anthropogenically forced climate change and air pollution. Although interactions between the carbon cycle and climate have been a central focus, other biogeochemical feedbacks could be as important in modulating future climate change. Total positive radiative forcings resulting from feedbacks between the terrestrial biosphere and the atmosphere are estimated to reach up to 0.9 or 1.5 W m(-2) K-1 towards the end of the twenty-first century, depending on the extent to which interactions with the nitrogen cycle stimulate or limit carbon sequestration. This substantially reduces and potentially even eliminates the cooling effect owing to carbon dioxide fertilization of the terrestrial biota. The overall magnitude of the biogeochemical feedbacks could potentially be similar to that of feedbacks in the physical climate system, but there are large uncertainties in the magnitude of individual estimates and in accounting for synergies between these effects.},

  abstract = {Information on the quantity and spatial distribution of canopy physiological
	and biochemical components is of importance for the study of nutrient
	cycles, productivity, vegetation stress and, more recently, in driving
	ecosystem models. In this context, remote sensing can play a unique
	and essential role because of its ability to acquire synoptic information
	at different time and space scales. This paper presents parts of
	a two-year field and laboratory study with the new airborne hyperspectral
	sensor, the Airborne Visible near Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIS),
	over a test site in the Bavarian Alpine foothills, Germany (48°8′
	N, 11° 17′ E). The 80-band AVIS was developed at the Department
	for Earth and Environmental Sciences of the Ludwig-Maximilians-University
	Munich and records the 550-1000nm spectral range. Using this system,
	18 hyperspectral datasets were collected between April and September
	of 1999 and 2000. Weekly measurements of several plant parameters
	(height, biomass, leaf chlorophyll content, leaf nitrogen content)
	were carried out during these time periods on three (1999) and six
	(2000) fields of winter wheat, whereby two different cultivars were
	investigated in 2000. After system correction and calibration, the
	hyperspectral data were atmospherically corrected and calibrated
	to reflectance. The resulting spectra were analysed for their chemical
	compounds. The statistical analysis was carried out using the Chlorophyll
	Absorption Integral (CAI) in comparison to established indices: Optimized
	Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (OSAVI) and hyperspectral Normalized
	Difference Vegetation Index (hNDVI). Both the chlorophyll and nitrogen
	content of the leaves showed good correlations with CAI on a field
	mean basis. These results as well as two-dimensional information
	on these parameters are presented to provide information about the
	spatial heterogeneity within a field.},

	on temporal (interannual) predictions of functional attributes of
	the ecosystem at regional scales. We tested the predictive power
	of ANNs and RMs using simulated data for six functional traits derived
	from the seasonal course of the normalized difference vegetation
	index (NDVI): the annual integral of the NDVI curve (NDVI-I), the
	maximum (MAX) and minimum (MIN) NDVI, the date of the MAX NDVI (DM)
	and the date of start (SGS) and end (EGS) of the growing season.
	For one of these traits (NDVI-I), we also generated a set of data
	that incorporated the effects of the state of the system in previous
	years (inertial effects). Even simple non-linearities in the actual
	functional form of the relationship between environmental variables
	and ecosystem attributes preclude a precise prediction of these attributes
	when the rules are not explicit. That was evident for predictions
	based on both ANNs and RMs under absolutely deterministic conditions
	(error-free scenario). Non-linearities in the simulated traits of
	the NDVI curve derive from multiplicative terms in the models. Under
	the presence of these non-linear terms, a different aggregation of
	the driving variables (monthly vs. annual or quarterly climatic data)
	reduce substantially the ability of both RMs and ANNs to predict
	the independent variable. For the six traits analyzed, the ANNs were
	able to make better predictions than RMs. The correlation between
	observed and predicted values of each of the six traits considered
	was higher for the ANNs than for the RMs. ANNs showed clear advantages
	to capture inertial effects. The ANN used was able to use previous
	year information on climate to estimate current year NDVI-1 much
	better than the RM that used the same input information.},

  abstract = {Leaf area index (LAI) products retrieved from remote sensing observations
	have been widely used in the fields of ecosphere, atmosphere etc.
	However, because satellite-observed images are captured instantaneously
	and sometimes screened by cloud, some current LAI products are inherently
	discontinuous in time and their accuracy may not meet the needs of
	users well. To solve these problems, we proposed a dynamic {B}ayesian
	network (DBN)-based data fusion algorithm that integrates dynamic
	crop growth information, a canopy reflectance (CR) model and remote
	sensing observations from the perspective of {B}ayesian probability.
	Using the proposed algorithm, LAI was estimated using data sets from
	both field measurements for winter wheat in Beijing, China, and MODIS
	reflectance data at two American flux tower sites. Results showed
	good agreement between the LAI estimated by the DBN-based data fusion
	method and the true ground LAI, with a correlation coefficient of
	(R) 0.95 and 0.96, respectively, and a corresponding root mean square
	error (RMSE) of 0.35 and 0.49, respectively. In addition, the LAI
	estimated by the DBN-based data fusion method formed a continuous
	time series and was consistent with the variety law of vegetation
	growth at both plot and flux tower site scales. It has been demonstrated
	that the proposed DBN-based data fusion algorithm has the potential
	to be used to accurately estimate LAI and to fill the temporal gap
	by integrating information from multiple sources. © 2012 Copyright

  journal = {Rem. Sens. Env.},
  year = {2014},

  pages = {639-651},
  abstract = {Incorporation of a priori defined plant associations into remote sensing
	products is a major challenge that has only recently been confronted
	by the remote sensing community. We present an approach to map the
	spatial distribution of such associations by using plant indicator
	values (IVs) for salinity, moisture and nutrients as an intermediate
	between spectral reflectance and association occurrences. For a 12km2
	study site in the Netherlands, the relations between observed IVs
	at local vegetation plots and visible and near-infrared (VNIR) and
	short-wave infrared (SWIR) airborne reflectance data were modelled
	using Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) (R2 0.73, 0.64 and 0.76 for
	salinity, moisture and nutrients, respectively). These relations
	were applied to map IVs for the complete study site. Association
	occurrence probabilities were modelled as function of IVs using a
	large database of vegetation plots with known association and IVs.
	Using the mapped IVs, we calculated occurrence probabilities of 19
	associations for each pixel, resulting in both a crisp association
	map with the most likely occurring association per pixel, as well
	as occurrence probability maps per association. Association occurrence
	predictions were assessed by a local vegetation expert, which revealed
	that the occurrences of associations situated at frequently predicted
	indicator value combinations were over predicted. This seems primarily
	due to biases in the GPR predicted IVs, resulting in associations
	with envelopes located in extreme ends of IVs being scarcely predicted.Although
	the results of this particular study were not fully satisfactory,
	the method potentially offers several advantages compared to current
	vegetation classification techniques, like site-independent calibration
	of association probabilities, site-independent selection of associations
	and the provision of IV maps and occurrence probabilities per association.
	If the prediction of IVs can be improved, this method may thus provide
	a viable roadmap to bring a priori defined plant associations into
	the domain of remote sensing. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

	using water retrievals from AVIRIS data from study sites located
	around the United States that included a wide range of environmental
	conditions. The ANN algorithm showed good performance across different
	vegetation types, with high correlations and consistent determination
	coefficients. The approach outperformed a multiple linear regression
	approach used to independently retrieve the same variable. The calibrated
	algorithm was then applied at the MODIS 500m scale to follow changes
	in CWC for the year 2005 across the continental United States, subdivided
	into three vegetation types (grassland, shrubland, and forest). The
	ANN estimates of CWC correlated well with rainfall, indicating a
	strong ecological response. The high correlations suggest that the
	inversion of RTM through an ANN provide a realistic basis for multi-temporal
	assessments of CWC over wide areas for continental and global studies.

	We review recent advances in detecting plant pigments at the leaf

	the basis of several operational algorithms to estimate canopy biophysical
	variables from satellite reflectance measurements. However, only
	little attention was paid to the training process which has a major
	impact on retrieval performances. This study focused on the several
	modalities of the training process within neural network estimation
	of LAI, FCOVER and FAPAR biophysical variables. Performances were
	evaluated over both actual experimental observations and model simulations.
	The SAIL and PROSPECT radiative transfer models were used here to
	simulate the training and the synthetic test datasets. Measurements
	of LAI, FCOVER and FAPAR were achieved over the Barrax (Spain) agricultural
	site for a range of crop types concurrently to CHRIS/PROBA satellite
	image acquisition. Results showed that the spectral band selection
	was specific to LAI, FCOVER and FAPAR variables. The optimal band
	set provided significantly improved performances for LAI, while only
	small differences were observed for the other variables. Gaussian
	distributions of the radiative transfer model input variables performed
	better than uniform distributions for which no prior information
	was exploited. Including moderate uncertainties in the reflectance
	simulations used in the training process improved the flexibility
	of the neural network in cases where simulations departed slightly
	from observations. Simple neural network architecture with a single
	hidden layer of five tangent sigmoid transfer functions was performing
	as good as more complex architectures if the training dataset was
	larger than ten times the number of coefficients to tune. Small sensitivity
	of performances was observed depending on the way the solution was
	selected when several networks were trained in parallel. Finally,
	comparison with a NDVI based approach showed the generally better
	retrieval accuracy of neural networks. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

	(Chl) is crucial to adequately interpret the chlorophyll fluorescence
	(ChF) signal from space. Accompanying information about the reliability
	of the Chl estimation becomes more important than ever. Recently,
	a new statistical method was proposed within the family of nonparametric
	{B}ayesian statistics, namely Gaussian Processes regression (GPR).
	GPR is simpler and more robust than their machine learning family
	members while maintaining very good numerical performance and stability.
	Other features include: i) GPR requires a relatively small training
	data set and can adopt very flexible kernels, ii) GPR identifies
	the relevant bands and observations in establishing relationships
	with a variable, and finally iii) along with pixelwise estimations
	GPR provides accompanying confidence intervals. We used GPR to retrieve
	Chl from hyperspectral reflectance data and evaluated the portability
	of the regression model to other images. Based on field Chl measurements
	from the SPARC dataset and corresponding spaceborne CHRIS spectra
	(acquired in 2003, Barrax, Spain), GPR developed a regression model
	that was excellently validated (r2: 0.96, RMSE: 3.82 \mu{\rm g/cm}2
	). The SPARC-trained GPR model was subsequently applied to CHRIS
	images (Barrax, 2003, 2009) and airborne CASI flightlines (Barrax
	2009) to generate Chl maps. The accompanying confidence maps provided
	insight in the robustness of the retrievals. Similar confidences
	were achieved by both sensors, which is encouraging for upscaling
	Chl estimates from field to landscape scale. Because of its robustness
	and ability to deliver confidence intervals, GPR is evaluated as
	a promising candidate for implementation into ChF processing chains.

  abstract = {ESA's upcoming Sentinel-2 (S2) Multispectral Instrument (MSI) foresees
	to provide continuity to land monitoring services by relying on optical
	payload with visible, near infrared and shortwave infrared sensors
	with high spectral, spatial and temporal resolution. This unprecedented
	data availability leads to an urgent need for developing robust and
	accurate retrieval methods, which ideally should provide uncertainty
	intervals for the predictions. Statistical learning regression algorithms
	are powerful candidats for the estimation of biophysical parameters
	from satellite reflectance measurements because of their ability
	to perform adaptive, nonlinear data fitting. In this paper, we focus
	on a new emerging technique in the field of {B}ayesian nonparametric
	modeling. We exploit Gaussian process regression (GPR) for retrieval,
	which is an accurate method that also provides uncertainty intervals
	along with the mean estimates. This distinct feature is not shared
	by other machine learning approaches. In view of implementing the
	regressor into operational monitoring applications, here the portability
	of locally trained GPR models was evaluated. Experimental data came
	from the ESA-led field campaign SPARC (Barrax, Spain). For various
	simulated S2 configurations (S2-10m, S2-20m and S2-60m) two important
	biophysical parameters were estimated: leaf chlorophyll content (LCC)
	and leaf area index (LAI). Local evaluation of an extended training
	dataset with more variation over bare soil sites led to improved
	LCC and LAI mapping with reduced uncertainties. GPR reached the 10%
	precision required by end users, with for LCC a NRMSE of 3.5-9.2%
	(r2: 0.95-0.99) and for LAI a NRMSE of 6.5-7.3% (r2: 0.95-0.96).
	The developed GPR models were subsequently applied to simulated Sentinel
	images over various sites. The associated uncertainty maps proved
	to be a good indicator for evaluating the robustness of the retrieval
	performance. The generally low uncertainty intervals over vegetated
	surfaces suggest that the locally trained GPR models are portable
	to other sites and conditions. © 2013 International Society for

  volume = {119},
  pages = {208-221},
  abstract = {Species richness increases markedly during the first years after fire,
	driven mainly by the increase in the number of herbaceous species.
	However, such increase is variable in space and time, due to the
	role that the different plant life-forms can play after the fire
	disturbance. In addition, the absence of reliable species richness
	information can be a limitation for decision making when postfire
	management actions are needed. In this study we used QuickBird imagery
	to develop multiscale, spatially explicit predictive models of species
	richness in a burned area 1year after a fire. The study area is an
	abandoned dehesa (a Quercus suber (cork oak) open woodland with shrubs)
	of central Spain, which had been affected by a large summer fire.
	Two 90×180m macroplots were established, where species richness
	and percentage cover of various plant life-forms were measured at
	three spatial scales (1, 25, and 100m 2). Total plant species richness
	was related to reflectance and spectral contrast derived from the
	multispectral bands of QuickBird and to the Normalized Difference
	Vegetation Index (NDVI), by using regression tree analysis (RTA)
	and boosted regression trees (BRT). Furthermore, for the biophysical
	support of such models, plant species richness was related to field-based
	compositional data, and life-form percentage cover to satellite data.
	Results indicated that the relationship between species richness,
	reflectance and spectral contrast was strong and scale-dependent
	(1m 2: adjusted R 2=0.50; 25m 2: adj. R 2=0.65; 100m 2: adj. R 2=0.79),
	whereas NDVI played a minor role at all scales. At the finest sampling
	scale, a low range of species richness was related to a high variability
	of spectral and texture responses, due to the excess of spatial detail
	of the pixel size. At 25m 2, a higher range of species richness was
	related to a low variability of spectral and texture responses; this
	was probably due to the fact that the sampling size only captured
	certain portions of plant individuals or life-form associations.
	At the largest sampling scale (100m 2), the highest variability of
	species richness was adequately related to the spectral and texture
	responses, due to the spatial fit between the sampling plot size
	and both the pixel- and plant-sizes. Species richness was closely
	linked to life-form percentage cover (mainly to herbaceous plant
	cover), and life-form cover was adequately explained by satellite
	data, giving a biophysical support to our predictive models. Reflectance
	and spectral contrast were good predictive tools of total plant species
	richness at the largest sampling scale, but their predictive power
	diminished at the smaller scales. This was explained by the range
	of species richness measured at each scale, the spatial arrangement
	of species, and the ratio of the spatial resolution (both for pixels
	from satellite data and for ground sampling plots) to the size of
	the objects. These results contribute to improve our knowledge about
	the link between high spatial resolution remotely sensed data and
	species richness at different sampling scales. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

	the impact of the employed method on estimation accuracies: numerical
	optimization (downhill simplex method), a lookup table (LUT) and
	an artificial neural network (ANN) approach. By numerical optimization
	(Num Opt), reliable estimates were obtained for LAI and canopy chlorophyll
	contents (LAI × Cab) with r2 of 0.85 and 0.94 and RDP values of
	1.81 and 2.65, respectively. Accuracies dropped for canopy water
	(LAI × Cw) and dry matter contents (LAI × Cm). Nevertheless, the
	range of leaf water contents (Cw) was very narrow in the studied
	plant material. Prediction accuracies generally decreased in the
	order Num Opt &gt; LUT &gt; ANN. This decrease in accuracy mainly
	resulted from an increase in offset in the obtained values, as the
	retrievals from the different approaches were highly correlated.
	The same decreasing order in accuracy was found for the difference
	between the measured spectra and those reconstructed from the retrieved
	variable values. The parallel application of the different inversion
	techniques to one collective data set was helpful to identify modelling
	uncertainties, as shortcomings of the retrieval algorithms themselves
	could be separated from uncertainties in model structure and parameterisation

	estimate paddy rice LAI from canopy hyperspectral reflectance and
	(3) to compare multiple linear regression-MLR, partial least squares-PLS
	regression and LS-{SVM} to determine paddy rice LAI using the selected
	wavebands. In the study, measurements of hyperspectral reflectance
	(350-2500 nm) and corresponding LAI were made for a paddy rice canopy
	throughout the growing seasons. On the basis of the wavebands selected
	previously, models based on MLR, PLS and LS-{SVM} to estimate rice
	LAI were compared using the data from 123 observations, which were
	split randomly for model calibration (2/3) and validation (1/3).
	Root mean square errors (RMSEs) and the correlation coefficients
	(r) between measured and predicted LAI values from model calibration
	and validation were calculated to evaluate the quality of the models.
	The results showed that the LS-{SVM} model using the 15 selected wavebands
	produced more accurate estimates of paddy rice LAI than the PLS and
	MLR models. We concluded that the LS-{SVM} approach may provide a useful
	exploratory and predictive tool for estimating paddy rice LAI when
	applied to reflectance data using the 15 selected wavebands. © 2010

  abstract = {Large areas of forest in the US and Canada are affected by insects
	and disease each year. Over the past century, outbreaks of the Eastern
	spruce budworm have become more frequent and severe. The notion of
	designing a more pest resistant landscape through prescriptive management
	practices hinges on our ability to effectively model forest-insect
	dynamics at regional scales. Increasingly, more detailed pixel-wise
	estimates of forest biophysical parameters are needed for such endeavors.
	Lidar technology, although promising, is not yet viable for repeated
	regional accounting, necessitating the development of methods which
	take advantage of existing spaceborne assets. Our objective is to
	use one of these assets (SPOT-5) to estimate a large set of forest
	structural attributes at a finer spatial grain size (5m and 10m)
	over a broader area than is currently available for the purpose of
	supplying needed input data for disturbance simulation modeling.
	We employ neighborhood statistics (standard deviation, variance,
	sill variance, and ratios of these metrics at 5 and 10m) calculated
	from SPOT-5 sensor data and derivatives to estimate and map tree
	canopy diameter (CDIA), bole diameter at breast height (DBH), tree
	height (HT), crown closure (CC), vertical length of live crown (LC),
	and basal area (BA). A partial least squares (PLS) regression approach
	was used with these local statistics and field data to produce models
	for pixel-wise estimation and mapping of mean values, respectively,
	for hardwood and coniferous forest CDIA (R2 = 0.82 and 0.93, RMSE
	0.62 and 0.47m), DBH (R2 = 0.82 and 0.90, RMSE 2.92 and 3.75cm),
	HT (R2 = 0.69 and 0.92, RMSE 1.27 and 1.59m), CC (R2 = 0.52 and
	0.68, RMSE 5.49 and 6.02%), LC (R2 = 0.58 and 0.81, RMSE 0.96 and
	1.25m), and BA (R2 = 0.71 and 0.74, RMSE 2.47 and 4.58m2 ha-
	1) for a 3600km2 area in northeast Minnesota. This approach for
	quantifying forest structure is robust in the sense that a detailed
	forest cover type map is not required to stratify analysis at any
	step in the process. Hence, we show that multi-resolution SPOT-5
	data are a practical alternative to lidar for regional characterization
	of forest biophysical parameters. However, lidar data may potentially
	be used to calibrate these SPOT-based structure models in the future.

	climate and crop yield models, describing the fluxes of energy, mass
	and momentum between the surface and the planetary boundary layer.
	To accurately determine the corn LAI, several methods of LAI estimation
	have been evaluated in this investigation, including vegetation indices,
	principal component analysis (PCA), the neural network method (NN),
	the look-up table (LUT) inversion from PROSAIL model and the Hybrid
	model. Comparisons were conducted based on field-measured corn canopy
	hyperspectral reflectance and LAI data over northeastern China. In
	order to fairly compare the LAI estimation performance of different
	methods, the groundmeasured data were separated into two sets (modeling
	data and validation data), except the LUT and hybrid methods of PROSAIL-based.
	The results indicated that the PCA method delivered the best performance
	for corn LAI estimation (with maximum R2 = 0.814 and minimum RMSE
	= 0.501) in this study. The hybrid model and EVI provided moderate
	results. Comparatively, the LUT and NN methods were less successful
	and NDVI provided the worst corn LAI estimation performance in this
	study. The PCA method shows great potential for performing well on
	corn LAI estimation from hyperspectral information. PCA can avoid
	the reflectance saturation defect of dense canopy in a certain extent,
	can utilize hyperspectral reflectance data much more effectively
	than other methods, and is not limited by the band numbers, it can
	also reduce noise and provide an great correlation with LAI from
	the hyper- bands or the multi- bands reflectance. © 2011 Elsevier

	Beijing-1 small satellite multispectral sensors (BJ1) images, acquired

	image data in this study. Considering a vertical distribution of
	forest LAI from both overstory and understory, a hybrid model of
	the invertible forest reflectance model (INFORM) was used to support
	the retrieval of forest LAI to eliminate the dependence of understory
	vegetation. The simulated data from INFORM outputs, added with a
	random noise, were first clustered by k-means method, and were then
	trained by ANN to obtain the inversion model for each group (cluster).
	Next, the inversion model was applied to the different combinations
	of multiangle data to retrieve the forest LAI. Finally, a validation
	of inverted results with Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
	LAI product and field measurements was conducted. The experimental
	results indicate that the accuracy of the inverted forest LAI can
	be improved through the addition of observation angle data, if the
	quality of the image data is ensured. The inversion accuracy of LAI
	with the multiangle image data is improved by 30% compared to the
	average accuracy of the inverted LAI with the single angle data after
	considering the addition of random noise to the ANN training data.

  abstract = {Recent advances in spectral imaging technology have enabled the development
	of models that estimate various crop parameters from spectral imagery
	data. We developed partial least square (PLS) models to predict fruit
	yield of Satsuma mandarin using airborne hyperspectral imagery obtained
	several months before harvesting. Hyperspectral images in the 72
	visible and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths (from 407 to 898 nm)
	were acquired over a citrus orchard during the early growing seasons
	of 2003, 2004 and 2005. The canopy features of individual trees were
	identified using pixel-based average spectral reflectance values
	for all 72 wavelengths from the acquired images. The acquired canopy
	features were then used as prediction variables to develop yield
	prediction models. These were developed using three techniques: (1)
	normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), simple ratio (SR)
	and photochemical reflectance index (PRI), (2) conventional multiple
	linear regression (MLR) models, and (3) PLS regression models. As
	we intended to predict yield several months before the harvesting
	season (generally late December), the conventional techniques (vegetation
	indices and MLR) did not predict well. In contrast, PLS models gave
	successful predictions for the three years. These results confirmed
	the hypothesized correlation between canopy features and citrus yield.
	The successful forecasting of yields several months or even one year
	ahead of the harvest season is expected to contribute to planning
	harvest schedules, generating prescription maps for dealing with
	fluctuations of yield in specific trees, control measures, and management
	practices. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

  abstract = {Alternate bearing is a well-marked yield variability phenomenon that
	occurs in almost all tree-fruit crops. The potential benefits of
	applying various alternate bearing control measures on alternate
	bearing crops can only be realized when yield information on individual
	trees of particular crops is obtained. The objective of this study
	was to examine the potential of airborne hyperspectral imagery to
	estimate the fruit yield in citrus. Hyperspectral images in 72 visible
	and near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths (from 407 to 898nm) were acquired
	over a citrus orchard in Japan by an Airborne Imaging Spectrometer
	for Applications (AISA) Eagle system. The canopy features of individual
	trees were identified using pixel-based average spectral reflectance
	values at various wavelengths from the acquired images, which were
	then used to develop yield prediction models. Yield prediction models
	were developed using five different techniques - (i) several vegetation
	indices (VIs), (ii) key wavelengths determined by simple correlation
	analysis (SCA), (iii) principal components (PCs) based on principal
	component regression (PCR), and (iv) PLS factors as well as (v) important
	wavelengths determined by B-matrix based on partial least squares
	(PLS) regression. The results indicated that the VIs used in this
	study were poorly correlated with fruit yield on individual trees.
	The key or important wavelengths determined by the two methods proposed
	in this study could provide reasonable prediction of fruit yield.
	Comparatively, the B-matrix method based on the PLS regression was
	superior to the simple correlation analysis in determining the key
	or importance wavelengths that are correlated to the fruit yield.
	However, the PCs extracted from the hyperspectral data were weak
	predictors of citrus yield. Greater prediction accuracy was obtained
	with the model based on PLS factors than with the models based on
	the key or important wavelengths. These results confirmed the hypothesized
	correlation between canopy features and citrus yield. The methods
	proposed in this study have considerable promise in estimating fruit
	yield on individual citrus trees. The yield information is valuable
	for planning harvest schedules and developing programs for application
	of tree-specific alternate bearing control measures and other management
	practices. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Physical principles applied to remote sensing data are key to successfully
	quantifying vegetation physiological condition from the study of
	the light interaction with the canopy under observation. We used
	the fluoreseence-reflectance-transmittance (FRT) and PROSPECT leaf
	models to simulate reflectance as a function of leaf biochemical
	and fluorescence variables. A series of laboratory measurements of
	spectral reflectance at leaf and canopy levels and a modeling study
	were conducted, demonstrating that effects of chlorophyll fluorescence
	(CF) can be detected by remote sensing. The coupled FRT and PROSPECT
	model enabled CF and chlorophyll a + b (C a+b) content to be estimated
	by inversion. Laboratory measurements of leaf reflectance (r) and
	transmittance (t) from leaves with constant C a+b allowed the study
	of CF effects on specific fluorescence-sensitive indices calculated
	in the Photosystem I (PS-I) and Photosystem II (PS-II) optical region,
	such as the curvature index [CUR; (R 675·R 690)/R 683 2]. Dark-adapted
	and steady-state fluorescence measurements, such as the ratio of
	variable to maximal fluorescence (F v/F m), steady state maximal
	fluorescence (F′ m), steady state fluorescence (F 1), and the effective
	quantum yield (ΔF/F′ m) are accurately estimated by inverting
	the FRT-PROSPECT model. A double peak in the derivative reflectance
	(DR) was related to increased CF and C a+b concentration. These results
	were consistent with imagery collected with a compact airborne spectrographic
	imager (CASI) sensor from sites of sugar maple (Acer saccharam Marshall)
	of high and low stress conditions, showing a double peak on canopy
	derivative reflectance in the red-edge spectral region. We developed
	a derivative chlorophyll index (DCI; calculated as D 705/D 722),
	a function of the combined effects of CF and C a+b content, and used
	it to detect vegetation stress.},

  abstract = {Remotely sensed data is the main source of vegetation leaf area index
	(LAI) information on the regional to global scale. Many validation
	results have revealed that the accuracy of the retrieved LAI is often
	affected by the cloud cover of imagery, instrument problems, and
	inversion algorithms. Ground meteorological station data, characterized
	by relatively high accuracy and time continuity compared with remote
	sensing data, can provide complementary information to remote sensing
	observations. In this paper, we combine the potential advantages
	of both types of data in order to improve LAI retrievals in the Heihe
	River Basin, an arid and semi-arid area in northwest China where
	Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) LAI values
	are significantly underestimated. A dynamic {B}ayesian network (DBN)
	is used to integrate these two data types for time series LAI estimation.
	Results show that the square of correlation coefficient between LAI
	values estimated by our DBN method (referred to as DBN LAI) and field
	measured LAI values is 0.76, with a root mean square error of 0.78.
	The DBN LAI are closer to field measurements than the MODIS LAI standard
	product values. Moreover, by introducing ground meteorological station
	data using a dynamic process model, DBN LAI show better temporal
	consistency than the MODIS LAI. It is concluded that the quality
	of LAI retrievals can be improved by combining remote sensing data
	and ground meteorological station data using a filtering inference
	algorithm in a DBN framework. More importantly, the study provides
	a basis and method for utilizing ground meteorological station network
	data to estimate land surface parameters on a regional scale. ©

abstract = "This paper addresses the problem of fusing multiple sets of heterogeneous sensor data using Gaussian processes (GPs). Experiments on large scale terrain modeling in mining automation are presented. Three techniques in increasing order of model complexity are discussed. The first is based on adding data to an existing GP model. The second approach treats data from different sources as different noisy samples of a common underlying terrain and fusion is performed using heteroscedastic GPs. The final approach, based on dependent GPs, models each data set by a separate GP and learns spatial correlations between data sets through auto and cross covariances. The paper presents a unifying view of approaches to data fusion using GPs, a statistical evaluation that compares these approaches and multiple previously untested variants of them and an insight into the effect of model complexity on data fusion. Experiments suggest that in situations where data being fused is not rich enough to require a complex GP data fusion model or when computational resources are limited, the use of simpler GP data fusion techniques, which are constrained versions of the more generic models, reduces optimization complexity and consequently can enable superior learning of hyperparameters, resulting in a performance gain."

@misc{Hegerl2011,
abstract = {Most detection and attribution studies use climate models to determine both the expected ‘fingerprint' of climate change and the uncertainty in the estimated magnitude of this fingerprint in observations, given the climate variability. This review discusses the role of models in detection and attribution, the associated uncertainties, and the robustness of results. Studies that use observations only make substantial assumptions to separate the components of observed changes due to radiative forcing from those due to internal climate variability. Results from observation-only studies are broadly consistent with those from fingerprint studies. Fingerprint studies evaluate the extent to which patterns of response to external forcing (fingerprints) from climate model simulations explain observed climate change in observations. Fingerprints are based on climate models of various complexities, from energy balance models to full earth system models. Statistical approaches range from simple comparisons of observations with model simulations to multi-regression methods that estimate the contribution of several forcings to observed change using a noise-reducing metric. Multi-model methods can address model uncertainties to some extent and we discuss how remaining uncertainties can be overcome. The increasing focus on detecting and attributing regional climate change and impacts presents both opportunities and challenges. Challenges arise because internal variability is larger on smaller scales, and regionally important forcings, such as from aerosols or land-use change, are often uncertain. Nevertheless, if regional climate change can be linked to external forcing, the results can be used to provide constraints on regional climate projections.

property, that they get smaller the further you move away from the
training cases. We give a thorough analysis. Inspired by the analogy to
non-degenerate Gaussian Processes, we suggest augmentation to solve the
problem. The purpose of the resulting model, RVM*, is primarily to
corroborate the theoretical and experimental analysis. Although RVM*
could be used in practical applications, it is no longer a truly sparse
model. Experiments show that sparsity comes at the expense of worse
predictive distributions.},

		  technique for regression and classification, combining
		  excellent generalisation properties with a sparse kernel
		  representation. However, it does suffer from a number of
		  disadvantages, notably the absence of probabilistic
		  outputs, the requirement to estimate a trade-off parameter
		  and the need to utilise `Mercer' kernel functions. In this
		  paper we introduce the Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), a
		  Bayesian treatment of a generalised linear model of
		  identical functional form to the SVM. The RVM suffers from
		  none of the above disadvantages, and examples demonstrate
		  that for comparable generalisation performance, the RVM
		  requires dramatically fewer kernel functions.},

abstract="Recently, the following Discrimination-Aware Classification Problem was introduced: Suppose we are given training data that exhibit unlawful discrimination; e.g., toward sensitive attributes such as gender or ethnicity. The task is to learn a classifier that optimizes accuracy, but does not have this discrimination in its predictions on test data. This problem is relevant in many settings, such as when the data are generated by a biased decision process or when the sensitive attribute serves as a proxy for unobserved features. In this paper, we concentrate on the case with only one binary sensitive attribute and a two-class classification problem. We first study the theoretically optimal trade-off between accuracy and non-discrimination for pure classifiers. Then, we look at algorithmic solutions that preprocess the data to remove discrimination before a classifier is learned. We survey and extend our existing data preprocessing techniques, being suppression of the sensitive attribute, massaging the dataset by changing class labels, and reweighing or resampling the data to remove discrimination without relabeling instances. These preprocessing techniques have been implemented in a modified version of Weka and we present the results of experiments on real-life data.",

@article{Barocas2014,
  abstract = {This article addresses the potential for disparate impact in the data mining processes that are taking over modern-day business. Scholars and policymakers had, until recently, focused almost exclusively on data mining’s capacity to hide intentional discrimination, hoping to convince regulators to develop the tools to unmask such discrimination. Recently there has been a noted shift in the policy discussions, where some have begun to recognize that unintentional discrimination is a hidden danger that might be even more worrisome. So far, the recognition of the possibility of unintentional discrimination lacks technical and theoretical foundation, making policy recommendations difficult, where they are not simply misdirected. This article provides the necessary foundation about how data mining can give rise to discrimination and how data mining interacts with anti-discrimination law.<br><br>The article carefully steps through the technical process of data mining and points to different places within the process where a disproportionately adverse impact on protected classes may result from innocent choices on the part of the data miner. From there, the article analyzes these disproportionate impacts under Title VII. The Article concludes that Title VII is largely ill equipped to address the discrimination that results from data mining. Worse, due to problems in the internal logic of data mining as well as political and constitutional constraints, there appears to be no easy way to reform Title VII to fix these inadequacies. The article focuses on Title VII because it is the most well developed anti-discrimination doctrine, but the conclusions apply more broadly because they are based on the general approach to anti-discrimination within American law.},

abstract="Recently, the following Discrimination-Aware Classification Problem was introduced: Suppose we are given training data that exhibit unlawful discrimination; e.g., toward sensitive attributes such as gender or ethnicity. The task is to learn a classifier that optimizes accuracy, but does not have this discrimination in its predictions on test data. This problem is relevant in many settings, such as when the data are generated by a biased decision process or when the sensitive attribute serves as a proxy for unobserved features. In this paper, we concentrate on the case with only one binary sensitive attribute and a two-class classification problem. We first study the theoretically optimal trade-off between accuracy and non-discrimination for pure classifiers. Then, we look at algorithmic solutions that preprocess the data to remove discrimination before a classifier is learned. We survey and extend our existing data preprocessing techniques, being suppression of the sensitive attribute, massaging the dataset by changing class labels, and reweighing or resampling the data to remove discrimination without relabeling instances.

learning a nonlinear transformation of the {GP} outputs. This allows for

chooses a nonlinear transformation such that transformed data is
well-modelled by a {GP}. This can be seen as including a preprocessing
transformation as an integral part of the probabilistic modelling problem,
rather than as an ad-hoc step. We demonstrate on several real regression..},

abstract="Recently, the following Discrimination-Aware Classification Problem was introduced: Suppose we are given training data that exhibit unlawful discrimination; e.g., toward sensitive attributes such as gender or ethnicity. The task is to learn a classifier that optimizes accuracy, but does not have this discrimination in its predictions on test data. This problem is relevant in many settings, such as when the data are generated by a biased decision process or when the sensitive attribute serves as a proxy for unobserved features. In this paper, we concentrate on the case with only one binary sensitive attribute and a two-class classification problem. We first study the theoretically optimal trade-off between accuracy and non-discrimination for pure classifiers. Then, we look at algorithmic solutions that preprocess the data to remove discrimination before a classifier is learned. We survey and extend our existing data preprocessing techniques, being suppression of the sensitive attribute, massaging the dataset by changing class labels, and reweighing or resampling the data to remove discrimination without relabeling instances. These preprocessing techniques have been implemented in a modified version of Weka and we present the results of experiments on real-life data.",

learning a nonlinear transformation of the {GP} outputs. This allows for

chooses a nonlinear transformation such that transformed data is
well-modelled by a {GP}. This can be seen as including a preprocessing
transformation as an integral part of the probabilistic modelling problem,
rather than as an ad-hoc step. We demonstrate on several real regression..},
